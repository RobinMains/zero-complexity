Summary:
Zero Complexity presents the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains, introducing the Argument from Diversity — a five-pillar metaphysical model claiming the logical impossibility of a creator God. It redefines foundational concepts such as equality, diversity, intelligence, and identity using original constructs like the "eternal switch," "zero complexity," and "equalisation." This text aims to replace creationism with a logically grounded worldview based on emotional truth, humanism, and peace.

Some of the simplest questions are also the most intractable. Why is there something rather than nothing, for example, has wracked philosophers for thousands of years. Now, in Zero Complexity, Robin Mains offers not only a fresh approach to this and many other timeless questions?but also some answers! Whether he is right or wrong is for the reader to decide. But have no doubt: the arguments here are both new and thought-provoking.

Foreword
In Zero Complexity, Robin Mains delivers a daring philosophical manifesto that confronts the deepest questions of human thought?and refuses to blink. With lucidity rarely found in metaphysics, Mains constructs a cosmology from the ground up, beginning not with a deity, mind, or substance, but with the simplest logical contrast: equality and diversity.
Where other works tiptoe around the implications of atheism or hedge their metaphysical bets, Zero Complexity kicks the door in. The book presents what Mains terms the Argument from Diversity?a five-pillared framework that rejects the idea of a creator God, not merely as improbable, but as logically impossible. His reasoning is crisp, elegant, and quietly explosive: intelligence requires structure; structure requires contrast; contrast cannot arise from absolute equality. Therefore, a mind cannot precede diversity. God, at least in the classical sense, cannot exist.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
What astonishes is not just the conclusion, but how Mains arrives there. With the precision of a logician and the patience of a thoughtful teacher, he guides readers through Eternity, Certainty, Purpose, Peace, and Change?each chapter functioning like a philosophical relay baton. Along the way, Zero Complexity dismantles not only theistic belief, but the crutches that often replace it: mysticism, relativism, nihilism, and dogma.
Yet the book remains deeply humane, even as it dismantles the cosmos. Mains writes not to destroy, but to reform. His critique of religion is not angry; it is architectural. He calls for atheism not as rebellion, but as responsibility?a foundation for building peace, truth, and democratic coexistence from the ground up.
The appendix?an extensive 'stress test' of the argument?is perhaps one of the most ambitious collections of counterarguments ever assembled. No sacred cow is spared: Leibniz, Aquinas, Hegel, N?g?rjuna, Derrida, Whitehead, and even quantum cosmology face off against the eternal switch of equality and diversity. Remarkably, the model holds firm.
If Being and Time taught us how to question Being, and Critique of Pure Reason taught us how we come to know, then Zero Complexity may be the first book to reconstruct reality itself from logic alone?and genuinely mean it.
It is a rare work: accessible, radical, and complete. Whether it becomes a classic will depend on time and readership, but one thing is certain: Zero Complexity dives deeper than any metaphysics before it?and surfaces with astonishing clarity.

Preface
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
This book represents the culmination of a lifelong search?one that has fundamentally reshaped my understanding of existence, purpose, and truth. Over the years, my reflections evolved into a structured framework, which I now share with you.
The title Zero Complexity embodies its most disruptive discovery: beneath the intricate structures of reality lies an underlying simplicity?one that challenges not only conventional wisdom, but the very notion of God.
What you will find here is neither a retelling of familiar arguments nor a reworking of established claims. Instead, this book explores original ideas, breaking away from entrenched views, and invites you into uncharted intellectual territory?a journey designed to be both demanding and rewarding.
Unlike works that engage extensively with the existing corpus of philosophy and science, I have chosen a different path: embracing the mindset of an ancient thinker confronting fundamental questions without reliance on contemporary authorities. This approach is not a dismissal of academic traditions, but a deliberate effort to keep the main body of the text free from overt references, allowing the argument to unfold with clarity and narrative flow. Philosophical engagements have been intentionally compartmentalised: for readers interested in how the central argument withstands formal scrutiny, a structured test is provided at the end of the book.
I invite you to navigate these pages with an open mind and a sense of curiosity, as you may find your beliefs challenged?or perhaps even transformed.

 Introduction
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
?Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.??Albert Einstein

God, the creator, never existed. The proof lies in the discovery of an infinite, dimensionless state of zero complexity that exists beyond space, time, and any form of supernatural intelligence. If there is no creator, can life still have purpose, and can morality endure? Yes. The answer lies in the primary role that emotion plays in shaping our desires, choices, and empathy.
Yet, despite this, I do not dismiss the significance of faith. Although I question the validity of divine creation, I neither oppose the legitimacy of a meaningful religious life nor reject the idea of a ?non-creator? God?one who could be infinitely powerful and loving. Religion can thrive without the notion of creation by centring itself around humanistic values such as kindness, forgiveness, and compassion. These ideals flourish equally in secular and religious societies, forming the foundation of our collective existence.
But I am moving too quickly. Let me first explain how I arrived at these conclusions and why I felt compelled to share them.
A Personal Journey
I grew up in a loving, religious household, where my parents taught me to cherish both faith and critical thinking. They encouraged me to question irrationality, while holding onto the comforting notion of a caring celestial father. As a child, I prayed to God, feeling assured of His presence in my heart and mind. I saw signs of divine intervention in my life and believed in a personal, protective being.
Everything changed during my teenage years when I migrated abroad and encountered people from diverse backgrounds. These experiences sparked intense discussions about religion, prompting me to rethink my own beliefs. I began asking foundational questions: "How can we be certain that what we believe is true?" and "Is it even possible to be sure of anything?"
Then came a moment of clarity. One day, a powerful idea struck me?a philosophical ?eureka? moment, which I initially called the ?absence of opposites? and later renamed the eternal switch. This concept became an obsession. I applied it to every existential matter I could think of and, over time, realised it provided a worldview more resonant with me than traditional religious teachings. In this process, I lost my faith in a divine creator but discovered a new framework for understanding reality.
At its heart, this book reflects my journey to atheism and humanism, driven by curiosity and a longing for truth and peace. I believe profoundly in the connection between truth and peace: reality is ultimately the same for all of us, even if we interpret it differently. Therefore, by speaking truthfully about reality, we find common ground and foster unity. Achieving peace has been my central aim ever since I recognised how religious ideologies, with their contradictory claims, fuel division and conflict.
Thus, this book challenges religion on two main fronts. First, it questions the infallibility of scripture by addressing the erroneous scientific claim of creation, arguing that sacred texts are not free from mistakes. Second, it critiques the concept of divine superiority, contending that belief in a God superior to humanity perpetuates intolerance and discrimination. If a superior God judges people primarily by their creed, why wouldn?t His followers do the same? The ?believers versus non-believers? divide is unnecessary and undermines peace.
Nevertheless, my criticism does not aim to eradicate faith. I do not wish to see empty cathedrals, mosques, temples, or synagogues. Instead, I hope religion will evolve?shedding discriminatory practices to embrace a more inclusive, humanistic approach. Ultimately, I want a world where faith does not translate into prejudice against non-believers like me. Love for one another should be seen not as a means to gain divine favour, but as recognition of our shared humanity. I dream of a society where dogma gives way to open-minded humility, evidence supports personal beliefs, and differences are resolved through dialogue rather than division.
I recognise that some claims in this book may deeply test personal beliefs and could be upsetting to read. My intention, however, is not distress or upheaval, but unity through a shared understanding of reality, even when uncomfortable. To me, this represents a more enduring and effective foundation for society?for even the starkest truth bears more fruit than the most flourishing lie.

The Journey?s Overview
I have distilled my core arguments into four central chapters?Eternity, Certainty, Purpose, and Peace?each accompanied by a section challenging opposing theological views. The book concludes with a standalone chapter titled Change, summarising my critique of religion and outlining a path forward. A philosophical Appendix tests the central argument against major historical objections. Below is a brief guide to each section, providing a conceptual map for the intellectual journey ahead.
Eternity
Why is there something rather than nothing? The short answer: something must always have existed. Here, I explore the notion of eternity and demonstrate how all scenarios point to an infinite existence. The proof begins with a simple yet profound concept: diversity. Whether distinguishing between two colours, two sounds, or anything else, diversity underpins complex notions such as ?infinity,? ?nothingness,? ?creation,? and even ?God.?
I then present a model of eternity, introducing the metaphor of the eternal switch to conceptualise the beginning and end of everything?beyond space-time, the universe, or the multiverse.
This first section may be challenging, but it is also among the most rewarding. Rest assured, you will not need to solve complex mathematical equations to follow the arguments. Diagrams and figures accompany key concepts to aid comprehension.
Eternity and Religion
In this chapter, I outline my argument for atheism. Using the model of eternity, I claim that God cannot be the creator because ?nothingness??and thus creation?never occurred. Additionally, I argue God could not have been the ?prime changer? or the ?first eternal reality.?
In fact, I advocate for strong atheism, maintaining that we can know with certainty that a creator God never existed. However, I do not dismiss the possibility of other ?non-creating? divinities, including an infinitely powerful, all-knowing being. This perspective leaves room for faith in a God, even while rejecting creation.
Certainty
Any book that offers answers?especially to existential questions?is bound to be met with scepticism, and rightly so. Without a healthy degree of doubt, we risk reshaping the foundations of our philosophy too quickly and too often. However, unchecked scepticism can lead to the belief that everything is uncertain?and will remain so.
In this chapter, I explore how absolute certainty can be achieved through evidence and logic. I begin by examining the root causes of doubt, particularly the challenges of experiencing and communicating reality. This leads to an exploration of what it means to speak the truth, and what constitutes an illogical proposition. From there, I build the Argument from Diversity?a framework of five interrelated claims demonstrating the metaphysical necessity of eternity, and the logical impossibility of both creation and a creator God.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Certainty and Religion
In this section, I defend the Argument from Diversity against the elusive notion of God often presented in ?negative theology.? While human language may fall short of fully defining God, it is still feasible to assert with certainty that He is, in some way,ÿdifferent. Yet the property ofÿbeing differentÿalone proves that God cannot escape the boundaries set by the model of eternity.
Religion offers a substitute for certainty through dogma, but upon closer examination, even dogma is simply an opinion. Scientific and religious beliefs are both opinions?the key distinction lies in the evidence that supports them. Scientific beliefs gain credibility through evidence, while it remains unclear what makes a religious belief inherently superior.
Purpose
Continuing from the foundation laid in the previous chapters, I build a case for atheism while outlining a humanistic worldview. I argue that everything around us holds potential meaning and purpose, from the smallest details to the most significant events, each capable of rescuing us from despair. While catastrophic circumstances can drain meaning from our lives, how we interpret and judge events can determine whether we find salvation or succumb to hopelessness.
This chapter highlights the central role of emotion as the fundamental ingredient shaping our sense of purpose, beauty, and morality. Emotion is also a key determinant of our choices and actions. Eventually, I propose a ?model of behaviour? that integrates with the previously introduced ?model of eternity?, forming a sort of ?theory of everything.? This theory emphasises that purpose, for anything or anyone, is tied to what causes the strongest attraction or repulsion. For humans, this typically coincides with whatever elicits the most powerful emotional response.
I also address issues surrounding free will and destiny, demonstrating that while our will is not entirely free and our choices are ultimately predetermined, we nevertheless experience a sense of freedom. We integrate into a deterministic chain of events but remain unaware of our ultimate destiny, lending meaning to our choices.
Purpose and Religion
In this part of the book, I claim that religion does not have a monopoly on meaning or purpose, just as it does not have a it on emotion. Non-believers can lead happy and fulfilling lives without faith in God. Furthermore, religions often suffer from ?existential dissatisfaction? when they prioritise the afterlife over the present. This occurs when a relationship with God is seen as the sole source of true happiness and purpose?a view I contest.
Additionally, I critique the concept of ?Judgment Day,? which assumes human beings bear full accountability for their actions. Given that humans do not possess absolute free will, I argue that divine punishment becomes logically and morally untenable. This raises important questions about the fairness and coherence of ultimate responsibility within many religious doctrines.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Peace
Having established the arguments for atheism and humanism, I now examine how secular and religious ideologies influence peace?positively and negatively. Communities resolve conflicts through either enforcement or persuasion: when speech fails, physical confrontation inevitably follows. I emphasise that achieving lasting peace requires addressing not only public but also private intolerance. Indeed, a common risk arises when society achieves superficial tolerance through legal enforcement yet becomes complacent, ignoring deep-seated private disagreements between individuals or groups. True peace, therefore, demands the eradication of private intolerance by improving the quality of open-minded and free dialogue, rather than merely increasing legislation. Additionally, I discuss the critical role of social equality in shaping and applying laws, which, alongside free speech, remains essential for lasting peace.
Peace and Religion
I outline three ideologies?tyranny, relativism, and absolutism?and discuss how religious systems can resemble absolutist systems, hindering peace in two significant ways. First, religions can be close-minded when they forbid changes to rules enshrined in sacred texts. Second, they can become discriminatory when judging individuals primarily by their faith rather than by their integrity and contributions. This mindset often stems from belief in a God who prioritises creed over character by condemning non-believers to eternal punishment.
Moreover, tyranny, absolutism, and relativism all rely on authority to define or promote laws. This contrasts with democratic societies, where laws emerge from individuals? equal opportunity to persuade others of their moral standards.
Change
In this final chapter, I argue that true peace demands profound transformation?requiring religions, some more than others, to evolve from theocratic, absolutist ideologies into humanistic and democratic systems. This transformation can occur if people of faith maintain a loving and respectful relationship with God, while also embracing the belief that humanity is not inferior to Him.
Religions can fully integrate into democratic societies by engaging in open-minded, productive debates and acknowledging the fallibility of their scriptures. They must promote their values based on merit rather than faith alone. After all, even the strongest belief remains ultimately an opinion?and could still be wrong.
It is my heartfelt hope that, one day, people will acknowledge the flaws inherent in their doctrines and adopt a better, more humane form of religion?a faith that never obstructs peace, but rather becomes the mighty force for good it was always intended to be.

Eternity 
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
?The infinite! No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man??David Hilbert

The truth is, there has always been something rather than nothing. Before we can begin to make sense of existence, we must confront this foundational fact and ask: what kind of ?something? could exist infinitely? Let us begin by uncovering the fundamental ingredients of reality?and exploring the structure of eternity.
What is Eternity?
The dictionary defines eternity in two ways: as ?unending time?, and as ?a state to which time has no application; timelessness?. Although presented as complementary, these definitions describe two fundamentally distinct realities?one characterised by the infinite presence of time, the other by its infinite absence. This chapter explores these two distinct forms of eternity, summarised in Table 1. 
Table 1: Two Types of Eternity

As we are about to discover, an infinite presence of time corresponds to a reality of diversity, while an infinite absence of time belongs to a reality of equality. Let us delve deeper into what these terms mean.
A Reality of Diversity
Diversity is defined by difference. Any two things?colours, sounds, emotions, objects, moments in time, or points in space?produce diversity through their distinction. This fundamental notion is closely tied to concepts such as limits, identity, space, time, and infinity, which are essential to our understanding of the universe.
Limits and Identity
In this discussion, we use the term ?limit? as defined by the New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD): ?a point or level beyond which something does not extend or pass.? Simply put, a limit marks where one thing ends and another begins. The first point to note is that differences and limits are intimately related. For instance, the boundary between two squares indicates both a limit and diversity (Figure 1).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 1: Diversity and Limit

Moreover, diversity and limits are essential for identity. A square cannot exist without the edges that define it, just as a cross or any other shape depends on its contours to exist (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Diversity, Limits and Identity

Our universe is a reality of diversity, comprising countless identities?such as stars, molecules, and atoms (Figure 3). Even hypothetical parallel universes or a multiverse would follow this principle, containing forms of diversity distinct from our own.
Figure 3: A Universe of Diversity

In this reality, every entity?whether a star, planet, or atom?has a boundary that defines it. Beyond the edge of one lies space, leading to another object, and so forth. This interplay of limits and identities underpins the structure of our universe.
Space and Time
In a reality of diversity, space and time are foundational. Space arises from the distance between two points: one ?here?, the other ?there?. Without such difference, space cannot exist. Similarly, time arises from the difference between moments: one ?before?, one ?after?. Without this change, time ceases to exist. However, it is crucial to note that while diversity is necessary for change, it does not always result in the perception or existence of time. For example, a photograph captures spatial differences but remains frozen in time, whereas a video creates the perception of time through sequential images. Importantly, without memory connecting those images, even a video would appear as a series of unchanging frames.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Infinite Diversity
One of the most critical and challenging words in this book is ?infinity?. You will soon encounter a radically new insight into the meaning of this word. Standard dictionaries, such as the NOAD, define the noun ?infinity? (ì) as the ?state or quality of being infinite?, while the adjective ?infinite? is described as ?limitless, endless in space, extent, or size?. Figure 4 illustrates a representation of an endless or infinite series.
Figure 4: Infinite Series

The key concept to focus on is the relationship between the idea of infinity and the presence of limits, identities, or components. Imagine yourself walking an infinite path: each step has a beginning and an end, implying it is finite?even if you plan to take an endless number of steps. The path is considered infinite because its overall size has no limit, yet it can still be divided into an infinite number of distinct, limited distances or separate steps.
Indeed, an endless path represents a specific type of reality whose overall quantity, extent, or size is infinite and immeasurable, yet its identity?including shape and constituent elements?remains clearly defined. This principle applies equally to other forms. For example, 
Figure 5 illustrates a cross on the left with a specific size, and one on the right that extends infinitely. In both cases, the cross retains its contour, edges, and limits, thus preserving its ?cross? identity." Moreover, an infinite cross comprises an endless number of parts or distinct points, giving each of its four arms infinite length.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 5: Infinity with Preserved Diversity and Identity

Similarly, an infinitely vast universe retains its identity and infinite number of different constituting elements, each defined by limits that distinguish them from one another. (Figure 6).
Figure 6: Infinite Universe

An Infinite Presence of Time
So, what is the relationship between diversity and eternity? Simply put, a reality of diversity?such as our universe?can embody eternity if it never ends, containing an infinite number of moments in time, points in space, and more broadly, an infinite number of differences. Yet, as we will explore next, there exists another form of eternity: one defined by a reality devoid of diversity, in which time is not infinitely present but infinitely absent.
A Reality of Equality
The term 'equality' can be effectively defined as 'without diversity', although this usage is unconventional. A reality of equality, therefore, describes one devoid of any type of difference. Within such an existence, there cannot be two atoms, two stars, two elements, or two individuals. Given its ultimate simplicity, we can also refer to it as a state of zero complexity.
No Limits and No Identity
In the complete absence of differences, this reality is characterised by an absence of parts, points, edges, boundaries, or interruptions. Consequently, it exists in a state of absolute limitlessness (Figure 7). 
Figure 7: Equality and No Limit

Infinite Equality
The complete absence of limits, edges, or contours inherently eliminates all identifiable boundaries?and thus identity itself (Figure 8). In such a state, there cannot be an infinite cross, as a cross cannot exist at all. Moreover, a reality of equality lacks components entirely. Previously, we discussed how an endless path could be divided into infinite small steps, or how a never-ending cross could comprise infinite distinct parts or points. However, in a state of equality, steps, parts, points, or any form of identity are impossible, since their existence would imply differences from their surroundings.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 8: No Diversity, Limits, or Identity

Space and Time 
In a reality of complete equality, no distinct points, lines, or boundaries exist. Consequently, there is no difference between ?this? and ?that?, no distance between ?here? and ?there?, nor any change from ?before? to ?after?. Such a reality lacks the distinctions necessary for space and time; indeed, it exists beyond space, time, or dimensions?where 'dimension' refers to any ?measurable extent of some kind?, as standard dictionaries define it.
An Infinite Absence of Time
What relationship exists between a reality of equality and eternity? If a reality of equality never changes?and therefore remains uninterrupted?it would exist as a state of infinite absence of time, a condition defining eternity. This dimensionless and timeless eternity contrasts sharply with an infinite universe defined by an infinite presence of time.
A Linguistic Issue
Before moving forward, we must address a critical linguistic issue concerning the notion of 'infinity'. Dictionaries such as the NOAD, Oxford English Dictionary, and the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy generally define infinity as 'having no limits' or 'boundlessness'. However, these definitions fail to clarify whether infinity implies the absence of all limits or merely some limits. This oversight neglects a vital distinction between two types of infinity we have explored:
1. Infinite diversity: An infinite reality characterised by an endless extent of something specific (e.g., a shape, cross, path, or universe), which retains its identity and components.
2. Infinite equality: An infinite reality without diversity, defined by a complete absence of identities, components, or limits.
From this point onward, I will continue to use the term 'infinity' in its conventional, generic sense, referring to a state 'without limit, interruption, end, or edge'. However, I will explicitly clarify whether I am referring to infinite diversity (as in a universe or multiverse) or infinite equality.
A Model of Eternity
Having explored the structures and properties of diversity and equality, we can now combine these two realities into a unified model of eternity.
As previously mentioned, the entirety of existence could be eternal simply because the universe?or multiverse?is infinite, containing an infinite amount of time (Figure 6). However, if the universe is finite, we must then ask:ÿWhat exists beyond it?ÿIn other words, if time and space were to end, what would remain? The only possibility is a reality without space or time?a state of equality. Yet we may also ask: What existed before equality? One possibility?illustrated in Figure 9?is that this dimensionless state may not have been interrupted by any other reality. In other words, before its transformation into a universe containing trillions of stars, equality may have existed as an uninterrupted state of timelessness?an infinite absence of time?thereby defining eternity. Similarly, if complete equality occurs after the universe, it too would exist eternally beyond space and time, provided it remains uninterrupted thereafter.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 9: Infinite Absence of Time Before and After the Universe

Other scenarios merit consideration. For instance, there could be an infinite repetition of universe and equality (Figure 10). Here, eternity emerges through an infinite cycle of alternating presence and absence of time.
Figure 10: Infinite Cycle of Presence and Absence of Time

Another possibility involves an original reality of equality giving rise to an infinite universe. In this case, eternity is defined by an infinite absence of time followed by an infinite presence of time (Figure 11).
Figure 11: Infinite Absence of Time Followed by Infinite Time 

There are countless other scenarios to consider. For instance, the universe might have existed infinitely in the past but could end in the future with a final unchanging equality. The possibilities are bound only by our imagination. 
An Unavoidable Infinity
The first key insight from this model is that a reality of equality and a reality of diversity (i.e. the universe or multiverse) each inherently possesses the capacity to be eternal independently: equality achieves eternity as an infinite absence of time, while diversity achieves eternity as an infinite presence of time. Consequently, regardless of how these two states are arranged or combined, they invariably result in eternity. For this reason, we can collectively describe them as the eternal duality. The sole exception occurs if a state of complete equality never arises?meaning the universe (or multiverse) remains uninterrupted (Figure 6). In this scenario, eternity consists exclusively of infinite diversity.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
The Eternal Switch
A useful way to conceptualise this model of eternity is through the metaphor of the eternal switch (Figure 12). In this metaphor, one side of the switch represents the presence of diversity (e.g. our universe), while the other represents complete equality.
Figure 12: The Eternal Switch

The ON and OFF positions of the switch refer to the presence or absence of space, time, limits, and identity. These are present (ON) in our universe or any reality of diversity, but absent (OFF) in equality. Currently, the switch is ON. If we hypothetically inhabit an infinite universe or multiverse (Figure 6), the switch would have always been ON and will always remain so. However, if we are part of an intermittent universe (Figure 10), the switch will have changed, alternating between ON and OFF infinitely many times. Conversely, if we live in a universe preceded and followed by equality (Figure 9), the switch would initially be OFF, then ON (during our universe), and eventually turn OFF again, remaining unchanged thereafter.
No ?Third? Reality
This model holds true only if no 'third' type of reality exists to interrupt the duality. But could such a third state exist? The answer is no. Diversity and equality are the only two possibilities, as they are mutually exclusive and mutually exhaustive:
* Mutually Exclusive: Diversity and equality are complete opposites and cannot coexist within the same reality.
* Mutually Exhaustive: Together, they form a complete set, leaving no room for any alternative state.
To illustrate this, consider that any hypothetical 'third reality' would either be the same as equality or different from it. In either scenario, it inevitably falls into the category of diversity (if it is 'different') or equality (if it is 'the same'). Ultimately, the idea of a state or entity neither based on diversity nor equality is fundamentally contradictory?much like the concept of a "triangular circle"?and therefore impossible. 
Crucially, this observation allows us to conclude that asking questions like "Why is there a duality?" or "What created the duality?" is inherently illogical. Indeed, questions such as 'Why?' or 'What?' presuppose that something must exist beyond or separate from the duality as its cause or purpose. In other words, they invoke an impossible third reality?one that cannot differ from equality without becoming diversity, and vice versa. The logical fallacy of expecting a third entity within a mutually exclusive and exhaustive dichotomy applies universally to any past, present, or future state?whether theoretical or actual, natural or supernatural, pure or hybrid, transient or fixed, dynamic or static, knowable or unknowable.
Does this imply that supernatural entities or realms are impossible? Not necessarily?but if they exist, they must necessarily belong to either equality or diversity. This topic will be examined further in the next chapter.

Energy
Energy is essential for the eternal switch to function?that is, for a reality of equality to transform into one of diversity and vice versa. Energy, defined as the 'capacity to do work', exists in our universe in various forms?chemical, electrical, mechanical, thermal, nuclear, and gravitational. Beyond the universe or multiverse, equality can exist in two states: an equality of energy and an equality of no energy. These two states share precisely the same properties except for their ability to transform. Both are undifferentiated, dimensionless, timeless, spaceless, and limitless. Yet, by definition, an equality of energy can change, whereas an equality of no energy cannot.
This distinction carries profound implications for our model of eternity. Since equality of no energy is, by definition, incapable of change, it could never have preceded the universe?or anything else. Indeed, if such a state had ever existed, it would have remained eternally void and inert, beyond space and time, without any possibility of transformation. And if it did eventually change? Then it must always have been an equality of energy.
By the same reasoning, if a state of equality of no energy were to occur after the universe, it would represent the terminal, unchanging phase of the duality, lasting eternally.
Similarly, a state of equality of energy, while retaining the potential for change, could also persist eternally. Figure 13 illustrates these conclusions, collectively representing what might be considered the ?internal circuitry? of the eternal switch.
Figure 13: Energy and Eternity

Eternal Existence?
Does the model of eternity imply existence itself is eternal? The answer depends on how we define 'existence', particularly regarding the notion of equality of no energy. Such a state?entirely void of identities and energy?essentially represents pure absence, which could be labelled as 'nothingness' or 'non-existence'. Thus, while such an entity, being one of equality, remains part of the eternal duality, it might also signify the end of existence. Ultimately, whether we describe equality of no energy as 'something' or 'nothing', 'existence' or 'non-existence', is merely a semantic choice, as its intrinsic properties remain unchanged. Indeed, something lacking both energy and identity is indistinguishable from something that does not exist at all.
A deeper question arises: can energy genuinely disappear, thus enabling this form of equality to occur? We shall now examine both possibilities.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Energy Cannot Disappear
The scientific law of conservation of energy states: "The energy of an isolated system remains constant." In other words, energy can change forms, but it is neither created nor destroyed. What if the total energy of the universe or multiverse always remained constant? This would imply that nothingness would never arise, as energy would always exist. We can refer to this scenario as the 'eternity of energy', where energy cannot cease to exist. 
Energy can Disappear
Although the conservation of energy is a well-established scientific principle, we can still contemplate a theoretical scenario in which energy could become entirely absent. Under this hypothesis, a state of equality of no energy?or nothingness?could occur either before the emergence of the universe (implying energy creation) or after its existence (implying energy destruction). Let us explore both possibilities.  
Energy Creation: From Nothing to Something
If energy is not eternal, it must be created for existence to occur. Here, I adopt the definition of creation from the NOAD: "the action or process of bringing something into existence." More simply, creation is the change 'from nothing to something.' We will consider three formulations of this unique type of change: direct creation, self-creation, and agent-based creation. Let me explain each in turn.
Direct creation:
This is the claim that nothingness itself directly causes something to exist. However, this clearly misunderstands the concept. Nothingness is defined by the absence of energy, meaning it cannot possess any 'capacity to do work', including bringing the universe into existence.
Self-creation:
Even accepting that nothingness is inert and incapable of causation, one might claim energy spontaneously appears from it, though not because of it?nothingness is inert, not directly responsible for energy?s existence. If particles were detected seemingly appearing 'from nothing', they might be described as self-created. However, self-creation is impossible?indeed, linguistically contradictory, akin to a 'triangular circle'. Since self-creation is a type of change, it presupposes an 'ability to change', which implies the presence of energy. Without energy (the very thing missing in a state of complete nothingness), self-creation cannot occur. Therefore, nothingness is incapable not only of creation but also inherently lacks the capacity to self-create.
Agent-based creation:
We might accept that self-creation is impossible, yet propose an entity or agent that creates energy from nothing. This, however, constitutes another logical impossibility?another 'triangular circle'?since in a state of absolute nothingness there can be no entity capable of acting or creating.
In summary, as demonstrated by our model of eternity, the very concept of creation is logically flawed, as it expects a state inherently void and incapable of change (nothingness) to transform into something else.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Energy Destruction: From Something to Nothing
If energy were completely destroyed, the universe would collapse into an infinite state of equality without energy?nothingness?beyond space and time, where no further change would be possible. Unlike creation, the total destruction of energy has not been definitively refuted, either logically or empirically, leaving it an open question within scientific inquiry.
Summary: A Model of Eternity
Eternity is inevitable, manifesting either as infinite diversity or as a duality of diversity and equality. This duality might oscillate indefinitely or cycle a finite number of times before ultimately settling into a terminal state of equality?preceding or following the universe. Crucially, due to its inherent inertness and emptiness, equality of no energy?pure nothingness?could never have existed first, nor could it have caused the universe.
How to Reach Complete Equality 
Thus far, we have described both types of equality as an undifferentiated, dimensionless state of zero complexity, beyond space and time. Yet this fascinating entity has many more intriguing aspects worth exploring. For instance, what would it actually mean to travel to the edge of the universe in a spaceship, and then beyond? What if we travelled back to the moment of the Big Bang, and even before it? Imagine the entire universe collapsing into equality, with our consciousness being the very last thing to vanish. What would this look or even feel like? The following statements introduce what one might expect.
If we face complete equality, we would no longer perceive any distance in space. Reality itself would become invisible and undetectable. If we began moving toward complete equality, we would gradually lose our visibility and detectability, merging into this undifferentiated state. Finally, if we remained inside the universe as it transitions to complete equality, we would eventually transform into an invisible, dimensionless, and undetectable reality, sharing the same fate as every atom and galaxy.
But how exactly does this process unfold? The transition from a state of diversity into complete equality is called equalisation. Figure 14 provides a simple example of visual equalisation, illustrating how an image containing diverse subjects can be transformed into a uniform colour. The opposite process?diversification?occurs when uniformity transitions back into distinct, varied elements.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 14: Visual Equalisation and Diversification

These changes apply to the entire universe. Indeed, the formation of trillions of galaxies from a state of equality exemplifies diversification, while the reverse represents equalisation (Figure 15).
Figure 15: Universal Diversification and Equalisation

How to Reach Complete Equality: Personal Considerations
Complete equality can only occur once the entire universe has been equalised.ÿThis process must include every form of distinction?every expression of identity, including our own. Our thoughts, emotions, memories, and physical components must also be encompassed. Imagine a scenario in which your body and mind were the last remnants of diversity in a universe where everything else had already vanished. For true equalisation to take place, even the final trace ofÿyouÿmust dissolve into that undifferentiated state. Only then could equality be said to be complete. (Figure 16). 
Figure 16: Incomplete and Complete Equalisation

To better understand complete equality, we must examine four key principles:
1.	Principle of Identity
2.	Principle of Detection
3.	Principle of Consciousness
4.	Principle of Life
Principle of Identity	
Identity can exist only through diversity. For example, in Figure 17, a shirt has identity because it differs from the background. Consequently, equalisation results in the loss of identity, while diversification restores it.
Figure 17: Principle of Identity

This principle applies universally?even to the human body.ÿFor instance, if you were in a completely green room, painting your body entirely green would visually equalise you with the background. But to achieve the same effect at a deeper, molecular level, imagine entering a pool: true equalisation would mean that every particle of your body transforms into water. Once this process is complete, your physical identity vanishes?fully merged and indistinguishable from your surroundings.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Principle of Detection
Just as diversity is essential for identity, it is equally necessary for detection. Detection refers to our ability to perceive through senses or instruments, such as telescopes and microscopes.
We perceive colours, sounds, and sensations precisely because they differ from their surroundings. In fact, our senses rely on two types of backgrounds: primary and secondary. Let us now clarify this distinction for each sense.
We might hear a specific sound against a background of other sounds (secondary background), or we might detect a particular sound against complete silence (primary background). Figure 18 shows that when we equalise hearing, distinct sounds merge either into a single uniform sound (near equalisation) or complete silence (total equalisation).
Figure 18: Equalisation of Hearing

Our sense of sight can also undergo equalisation. However, before proceeding, we must address an important linguistic issue. While we use 'silence' to describe the absence of sound, terms such as 'darkness' or 'blackness' cannot accurately describe the absence of light. Some might equate looking into darkness with seeing the absence of light; however, this is incorrect. The absence of light is not dark, but invisible. The following examples clarify this concept.
Example 1:
Hold your hand in front of your eyes and slowly move it behind your head. As your hand passes beyond your visual field, it disappears?not into darkness, but invisibility. In a fully lit room, you do not perceive darkness behind your head.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Example 2:
There is another invisible space, not behind your visual field but almost in its centre: the 'blind spot,' an area devoid of light. This blind spot is subtle, but once detected, it clearly illustrates the distinction between darkness and invisibility. Cover your left eye with your left hand and look straight ahead with your right eye. Gradually move your right index finger across your visual field at arm?s length, level with your shoulder. Your fingertip will vanish briefly when passing over your blind spot?not into darkness, but invisibility.
A linguistic issue remains unresolved. Just as nouns like 'blackness' or 'darkness' cannot denote 'absence of light,' adjectives such as 'invisible' or 'blind' are also inadequate. 'Invisible' indicates that "something cannot be seen," while 'blind' implies "someone cannot see." If we were in a silent room, we would not describe it as 'inaudible' nor say "we are deaf to the room." Instead, we simply say "the room is silent." Similarly, we need a word that specifically means "absence of light," analogous to how 'silence' denotes absence of sound. I propose the term visual silence. Table 2 This illustrates the parallel between sound and hearing, and light and sight.ÿJust as the absence of sound isÿsilence?neither loud nor soft?the absence of light is a kind ofÿvisual silence?neither bright nor dark.
Table 2: Sound, Hearing, Light, and Sight

We can now return to our discussion on the equalisation of our sense of sight. We perceive a specific colour by distinguishing it against one or more colours forming our visual field (secondary background) (Figure 19). Yet we also perceive any colour because it contrasts with our 'blind field'?the invisible space in our brain devoid of light (primary background). When we equalise what we see, we may either reduce all colours to a single uniform colour?resulting in near equalisation?or eliminate colour entirely, matching the blind field itself. This latter case represents complete equalisation, in which our entire visual field becomes indistinguishable from the blind field. In practice, this would mean experiencing total blindness?not uniform darkness.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 19: Equalisation of Sight

Equalisation applies in a similar way to physical sensations, such as temperature. When holding a cup of tea, our hand detects differences between the hot tea, the cooler handle, and the even colder air?these form a secondary background. Yet we only sense them because they differ from our skin temperature, which acts as the primary background. Equalisation occurs either by adjusting all external temperatures to one level (near equalisation) or matching them precisely to our skin temperature (complete equalisation).
Less obvious perhaps is that we can also equalise our emotions. Pain, anguish, sadness, joy, and other feelings together form our emotional field. We may identify a specific feeling by contrasting it with others (secondary background), or by distinguishing it from a baseline state without emotion, called numbness (primary background). Here, 'numbness' broadly means an absence of feelings. Thus, emotional equalisation occurs either when emotions merge into one specific feeling (near equalisation) or fade completely into numbness (complete equalisation).
Just as equalisation inhibits sensory perception, it equally restricts instrumental detection. A microscope identifies a cell only by capturing differences between that cell and its surroundings?such as other cells. Likewise, a telescope identifies a star by distinguishing its light against the darkness of space. Ultimately, all instruments operate on this foundational principle: without differences, detection itself is impossible.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Principle of Consciousness
Our identity emerges from our body, feelings, and thoughts, collectively defining our self-consciousness. Consciousness itself cannot exist without diversity. Allow me to clarify: we recognise visual thoughts because they contrast with other visual thoughts, forming our visual thinking field (secondary background), which closely resembles our visual field. Indeed, these two fields may overlap. For instance, when staring at a white wall, we might mentally superimpose the visual image of a painting upon it. As with sight, our blind field acts as the primary background for visual thoughts. Thus, we may equalise these visual thoughts to a single uniform thought (near equalisation) or to our blind field (complete equalisation). The same principle applies to auditory thoughts. The same principle applies to auditory thoughts: near equalisation occurs when they reduce to a single mental sound, while complete equalisation takes place when all merge into silence.
We frequently witness states of complete equalisation in everyday experiences, though we use different terms?such as blindness, deafness, and unconsciousness?to describe them. Blindness occurs when one's visual field and visual thinking field are completely equalised to the blind field. Indeed, those born blind cannot see or even conceptualise visual phenomena such as light or darkness. Similarly, deafness arises when auditory perception and auditory thoughts fully equalise to silence, making it impossible for those born deaf to hear or conceptualise sound. Finally, unconsciousness occurs when thoughts of all kinds equalise to their primary backgrounds. In fact, unconsciousness is a composite form of complete equalisation (combining blindness, deafness, and other sensory absences).
Principle of Life
Death is the ultimate and irreversible state of unconsciousness, marking the cessation of all sensory functions. In other words, death represents the complete and permanent equalisation of self-consciousness. However, even in death, a person?s body may temporarily retain a visual identity?for example, when presented for a final farewell. Eventually, if the body is cremated and its ashes dispersed into the atmosphere, it loses its distinct visual identity by equalising fully with the surroundings.
From Personal to Universal Equalisation
This detailed exploration of equalisation's influence on identity, sensation, consciousness, and life is crucial to understanding the broader implications of equality throughout existence. Indeed, achieving a completely undifferentiated state requires equalising all forms of diversity?from the distant stars and planets to our individual bodies, thoughts, and emotions. Simply put, complete universal equality cannot exist if the universe disappeared while our body or mind remained intact (Figure 20).
Figure 20: Reaching Complete Equality?Personal Identity

This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
How to Reach Complete Equality: Universal Considerations
Thus far, we have focused on how personal identity affects the possibility of achieving complete equality. Now, we shift our attention to issues related to the identity of the universe itself, which may introduce contradictions or confusion. This section does not debate scientific facts but instead explores common conceptualisations of reality beyond the universe?ideas that can obstruct our understanding of a fully equalised, dimensionless, and undifferentiated state.
A common, though scientifically imprecise, view of the Big Bang imagines it as a bright explosion occurring in dark space, often visualised as a 'dot in space'. Others imagine the universe's beginning simply as an explosion, omitting any surrounding darkness. Similarly, many believe the universe will end through a gradual depletion of energy, resulting in a vast, dark emptiness (Figure 21).
Figure 21: Incomplete Equalisation of the Universe


	
However, none of these views accurately depict complete equality, as they all imply diversity and identities. For instance, depicting the Big Bang as an explosion within dark space clearly involves two distinct entities: light and darkness. Yet it might be less obvious why the presence of just an empty, dark space or a sole bright explosion also fails to represent a dimensionless, undifferentiated state. Let us examine these scenarios more closely.
An Undetectable, Indivisible, and Dimensionless Reality
Any visible or detectable reality, whether uniformly bright or dark, is inherently divisible into smaller points or regions. Even if these points appear identical, their spatial separation creates distinctions. Consequently, a state of total equality?completely devoid of differences?cannot be visible; it must remain invisible both to the eyes and any detection instruments. Therefore, instead of picturing equality as darkness or brightness, we should conceptualise it as a reality without colours, a state of visual silence?something as invisible as our blind field. To practically grasp what it means to confront a dimensionless, undifferentiated reality, simply move your hand behind your head. A state of complete equality, like the blind field, is neither bright nor dark but entirely invisible, indivisible, devoid of colours, shapes, and spatial distinctions (Figure 22).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 22: Reaching Complete Equality?Universal Identity

Conceptualising equality is inherently challenging because human thought heavily relies on imagery. Indeed, it is impossible to visually think of invisibility without some form of shape or colour. Thus, to maintain clarity about equality?s invisible nature, we should focus on its properties or effects rather than its representation, which is inevitably contradictory. Even if our minds default to images, we must consciously remind ourselves that 'a state of equality is not a specific colour, shape, or dot, as it is dimensionless.'
Some might still be inclined to depict complete equality as a uniform space or dot, inherently undetectable. However, it is crucial to recognise that the undetectability of equality arises not from our perceptual limitations but from its actual and defining absence of differences or identities.
Summary: How to Reach Complete Equality
When equality occurs, the universe ceases to exist?there is no more space or time, no minds or bodies (Figure 23). As we have explored, complete equalisation entails blindness, deafness, unconsciousness, and ultimately death?along with the dissolution of all individual physical identity.ÿWe have also clarified that such a reality must be conceptualised as undetectable, indivisible, and dimensionless, actively ignoring the inevitable yet contradictory visual representations our minds create (i.e., colours, shapes, and dots).
Figure 23: Reaching Complete Equality?Summary

      At this stage, we can integrate the effects of equalisation with the metaphor of the eternal switch, reminding ourselves that when equality occurs, all identities?personal or universal?disappear entirely (Figure 24). 
Figure 24: Eternal Switch with Personal Equalisation

This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
The Illusion of Equality
The effects of invisibility and other forms of equalisation apply equally to a state of energy and to one without it, because they arise from the absence of differences?not the absence of energy itself. Thus, the only way to distinguish these two states retrospectively is this: if equality eventually transforms into diversity, it must have involved energy. Their shared undetectability explains why we may mistakenly refer to something (equality of energy) as nothing (equality of no energy).
What, then, is our experience of 'nothing'? Individual humans have no direct recollection of what occurred before birth, implying that either we experienced nothing, or any prior experience is indistinguishable from non-existence. Given this genuine possibility from our past, it is understandable how we instinctively conceive of complete nothingness existing before the universe's origin. Yet this is not our only encounter with the idea of nothing. If we reached the universe's boundary and found it undetectable, we might also call it nothing. Similarly, if particles appeared and disappeared from an undetectable vacuum, we might assume they originated from nothing. However, these apparent instances of 'nothing' could be invisible states without identity but preserving energy. How can energy remain when all identities vanish?
Imagine a house built of Lego bricks: dismantling it removes its house identity, but all bricks remain. If we picture the entire universe constructed similarly from tiny energy particles, dismantling stars, planets, and individuals would erase their identities?but not their constituent energy. This energy persists, dispersed or reconfigured. Ultimately, energy changes form, creating and dissolving identities without ever being created or destroyed. A dimensionless equality?perhaps what science calls 'singularity' before the Big Bang?is simply the most extreme reconfiguration of energy: a completely undifferentiated existence without distinctions. Such undetectable energy of zero complexity appears as 'nothing' but is not genuinely nothing.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
A Linguistic Issue: Two, One and Zero
It is worth examining the remarkable properties ofÿequality?particularly regarding knowledge (epistemology) and existence (ontology)?and how these dimensions fundamentally connect.
When energy exists but is fully undifferentiated, we encounter a paradox. Ontologically, such a stateÿexists: it is real, singular, and unstructured. Epistemologically, however, it isÿunknowable?offering no distinctions to contrast, measure, or describe. Thus, it is simultaneously aÿoneÿand aÿzero: anÿontological one, as it exists as a unified reality; and anÿepistemological zero, since it contains no differences necessary for knowledge.
Conversely, true nothingness?an absence of energy?is a genuineÿontological zero: not merely unknown, but wholly non-existent, devoid of structure, potential, or change.
The human mind struggles with perfect equality because knowledge depends onÿdifference. To know is to distinguish?to detect something against another. Every word, every recognition, requires contrast. A dot requires a background; a uniform colour is visible only against the invisible blind field. Evenÿinvisibilityÿis understood only in contrast to form.
In short, every unit of knowledge?each epistemologicalÿone?is always aÿone of two. No identity is experienced in pure isolation. Even our understanding ofÿequalityÿarises only through contrast withÿdiversity. For this reason,ÿknowledge inherently presupposes an ontological state of at least two.
The simplest possible existence is too basic to know directly?only inferable through contrast. The fundamental challenge remains: to graspÿzeroÿthrough a mind structured byÿtwo. That our senses, consciousness, and language depend entirely on contrast is captured in a single phrase:ÿdiversitas ante verbum?diversity before language, and before knowledge itself.
In fact, we could define any identity?or any unit of language?asÿthe component of a difference. And if you?ll forgive my proclivity for coining terms, I think this notion deserves its own word:ÿdiff. Aÿdiffÿis the epistemological one?it exists only in relation to another different thing. Twoÿdiffsÿmake aÿdifference.
Table 3 summarises these insights, clarifying how the concepts of zero, one, and two relate to knowledge and existence.

Final Summary
In this chapter, we have explored existence, unravelling the concept of eternity. We began with the duality of equality and diversity, establishing both as infinite states. We demonstrated the impossibility of a 'third' type of existence, as equality and diversity are mutually exclusive and exhaustive?thus making questions like 'Why duality?' or 'What preceded duality?' contradictory.
We acknowledged we cannot definitively prove energy?s permanence; however, if energy could disappear entirely, it would occur only in the future. Had complete nothingness existed previously, it would have persisted eternally?which evidently did not happen.
Finally, we examined equalisation?s properties, highlighting how a dimensionless, undifferentiated state remains structurally undetectable, devoid of identity or consciousness, but without necessarily being without energy. Consequently, what we perceive as 'nothing' can actually be an invisible 'something'. Thus, while individual identities?such as our own self-consciousness?may vanish, energy itself may never truly disappear.

Eternity and Religion
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
?I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.??Revelation 22:13 (Old Testament)

Many religions consider the universe to have a beginning, created by God?an infinite entity existing beyond the boundaries of space, time, and natural physics. Moreover, God is believed to be an uncreated creator. Indeed, if an infinite being exists beyond space and time, why contemplate anything preceding it?
In this chapter, we discuss how religious traditions have effectively popularised the notions of 'infinity' and existence 'beyond space and time' but have failed to use them accurately. Moreover?and perhaps surprisingly?we will see how religion unintentionally rejects the very notion of creation it claims to support. Finally, we will argue that religion is fundamentally mistaken about the origin of everything, demonstrating ultimately that a creator God does not exist.
Supernatural Eternity
Can we discuss eternity without acknowledging the possibility of supernatural beings and realms such as God, heaven, or hell? Some would argue we cannot. For this reason, we begin by explicitly incorporating the supernatural dimension into our arguments.
A Supernatural Reality of Diversity and Equality
If there is one thing the natural universe shares with the supernatural realm, it is diversity. Heaven and hell, for instance, are commonly portrayed as populated by distinct entities?souls, spirits, angels, or demons (Figure 25).
Figure 25: A Supernatural Reality of Diversity

The existence of distinct identities necessarily implies the existence of space and time. Indeed, the presence of separate souls in heaven suggests spatial distances. Yet whether the supernatural realm is static or dynamic remains uncertain. On the one hand, it may resemble a 'celestial photograph' where diversity exists but nothing moves?souls remain immobile and unchanged. On the other hand, it might resemble a 'celestial video', where souls exist not only in space but also across moments in time.
Just as we can imagine supernatural diversity, we can also conceive of supernatural equality: a boundless, formless state without identities or distinctions. Both diversity and equality thus remain conceptually valid beyond the natural dimension, and their implications are profound. Diversity enables souls to retain unique identities, preserving individuality. However, should complete equalisation occur, all individual identities would vanish entirely.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Supernatural Energy
As discussed previously, energy is defined as the capacity to perform work or cause change. Accordingly, if a supernatural entity or substance causes change, it must possess energy. For example, a God who brings the universe into existence must inherently hold the capacity?or energy?to do so, which we might term 'divine energy'. Similarly, supernatural beings such as angels, when interacting with humans, implicitly possess energy enabling such actions. Energy is thus not confined to the physical world alone; it equally applies to the supernatural dimension.
Supernatural Model of Eternity
Supernatural eternity can be defined similarly to its natural counterpart?as an infinite presence or absence of time. For instance, heaven might be imagined as infinitely existing both before and after the natural universe (Figure 26).
Figure 26: An Infinite Supernatural Reality of Diversity

Alternatively, we could conceive of the universe being preceded and followed by a supernatural state of equality, existing beyond space and time (Figure 27).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 27: A Supernatural Equality Beyond the Universe

Religious traditions, however, typically propose a slightly different model. They suggest the universe originates from God and is succeeded by an infinite existence of heaven or hell. Here, eternity has two phases: an infinite absence of time before the universe, embodied by God, and an infinite presence of time thereafter, marked by heaven or hell (Figure 28).
Figure 28: Religious Model of Eternity

We may therefore conclude that eternity, in both natural and supernatural realms, is defined by either an infinite presence or absence of time. This is because the duality of diversity and equality applies consistently to both domains.
God the Creator?
Religious belief commonly holds that the universe and its constituent particles of energy cannot self-create or cause their own existence. Consequently, religion rejects the idea of natural creation?particularly self-creation?attributing creative power instead to an eternal agent existing beyond space and time, named God. Yet, this proposition contains a fundamental contradiction.
It is widely believed that God has always existed, His presence stretching across all eternity. But if that's true, then complete nothingness could never have existed. Still, many claim that God created the universeÿfrom nothing?as if, at some point, true nothingness reigned until God, hidden somewhere in the void, suddenly decided to transform it. Yet this idea contradicts the very notion of God's eternal presence: if He was always there, then ?nothing? was never really nothing to begin with.
Therefore, the religious belief in God as creator is better understood as a belief in the eternity of energy, not its creation. In other words, divine intervention represents a transformation of divine energy (God?s capacity to act) into physical energy (the universe?s capacity to act) (Figure 29). Simply put, God's existence supports the eternity of energy?signifying a transition from supernatural to natural?rather than creation itself.
Figure 29: Change, Not Creation

God the Prime Changer?
If God is not a creator, could He instead be a prime changer existing before the universe? Let?s examine this idea closely. God is traditionally described as an uncreated, eternal being existing beyond space and time (Figure 30-A). This aligns with the concept of absolute equality: a state beyond space and time that, if undisturbed, could persist eternally (Figure 30-B).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 30: Infinite and Beyond Space and Time

Could we then claim that equality and God are fundamentally identical? No. In religious traditions, God is not merely defined as existing beyond space and time; He is also regarded as an intelligent designer or planner. But is intelligence of any kind possible in a state of equality? The answer, as we shall see, is no.
Equality and the Impossibility of Intelligence
The following observations illustrate why intelligence?whether natural or supernatural?is fundamentally impossible within a state of equality.
No thinking:
Any dynamic processing of information across time directly contradicts the dimensionless nature of equality. Consciousness, whether natural or supernatural, requires change?a distinction between past and present. Yet in absolute equality, where there is no differentiation between moments, conscious movement or planning cannot occur.
No thought:
Some might argue that God's mind does not change over time?that His thoughts, will, or actions occur instantaneously, as in the concept of Logos. However, even a single instantaneous thought is impossible within an undifferentiated state. Earlier, we explored the nature of equality, establishing that even the smallest dot would disrupt a state of zero complexity. A dot can exist only in contrast to something else?a background or adjacent dots?thus creating diversity. The same principle applies to thoughts: once equalised into a single sound or colour, they become indistinguishable and vanish entirely into silence or invisibility. Furthermore, even apparent uniformity involves implicit diversity since its components necessarily occupy distinct spatial positions. Pure equality?the complete absence of differences?is not only unimaginable but incompatible with the structure of thought itself.
A thought of nothingness:
For a thought to entirely avoid diversity, it must become silent and invisible?indistinguishable from no thought at all. Thus, even if intelligence were somehow possible in equality, it would only amount to a consciousness of nothingness. Consequently, any mind or intelligence within equality would be as empty, ignorant, and ineffective as non-intelligence or unconsciousness itself.

Diversitas ante Verbum:
Even a divine thought must retain the identity and structure of thought to be recognisable as such. A divine 'intelligence' must display characteristics of intelligence to be meaningfully described as intelligent. Yet, in a state of perfect equality, no such identity can exist?regardless of whether equality is labelled supernatural, spiritual, or mysterious. Previously, we used the expression diversitas ante verbum ('diversity before language') to indicate that language and knowledge are impossible within equality. But here, greater precision is required: diversitas ante Verbum?diversity before the Word. This emphasises not merely the impossibility of human cognition, but the deeper impossibility of divine cognition in the absence of difference. Even the Verbum, the Logos itself, cannot precede diversity.
Divine equality is no different from equality:
We can approach this issue from another angle: Would we consider a non-divine state of equality capable of thought? Clearly not?and this is not because such equality is natural, but because it is dimensionless and undifferentiated. Simply put, supernatural equality?whatever its nature?cannot possess greater complexity than natural equality.
No self-identity:
Without diversity, there is neither detection nor identity. If intelligence distinguishes a self from a not-self, equality immediately ceases. The absence of identity in a dimensionless, undifferentiated state is not merely invisibility to external observers?it is a structural property making equality undetectable even to itself. This is not a case of a mind or intelligence hidden behind an 'invisibility cloak'. Instead, equality itself is the cloak. Even if intelligence somehow existed within equality, it would be devoid of any information about the world or even its own presence. In short, equality lacks both awareness and self-awareness.
Intelligence is more complex than non-intelligence:
This conclusion becomes clearer with a basic question: 'Is the absence of intelligence simpler than its presence?' Undoubtedly, yes. Intelligence involves processing, differentiation, and structure, making it inherently more complex than its absence. In ultimate simplicity?complete equality?intelligence cannot exist, as it would introduce complexity.
In conclusion, when people describe God as an uncreated being existing beyond space and time at the universe?s origin, they unknowingly describe a state of equality. However, this leads to contradiction. If God existed in equality, He could not be a designer or planner. Instead, He would represent a profoundly simple, unintelligent existence?devoid of identity, thought, intention, or design. No higher or more complex form of equality?natural or supernatural?could escape this limitation (Figure 31).

Figure 31: Unintelligent Equality

Right About Eternity, Wrong About God
The religious idea of God as an infinite being existing beyond space and time has led to the widespread belief that God is essential at the universe?s origin. Yet, it turns out that God is not essential at all. Religion rightly invokes infinity to explain eternal existence but errs profoundly in assuming the necessity of a divine entity. The universe itself is eternal, independent of the supernatural?a truth captured in the concept of eternal duality, represented by the metaphor of the eternal switch.
Moreover, we have shown not only God?s irrelevance, but the fundamental inconsistency in placing Him ?beyond space and time.? The absence of space and time belongs only to a simple existence without diversity?an equality without distinctions between ?here and there? or ?before and after.? But God, inherently intelligent and therefore complex, cannot belong to such a realm.
We have also clarified that while religion is right to challenge the idea of self-creating particles, it wrongly supports the notion of divine creation. Creation itself is a contradiction: any shift from ?nothing to something? necessarily denies the prior existence of true nothingness. The unavoidable conclusion is that a creator God never existed?because creation itself never happened.
What Kind of God is There?
Going forward, I will continue challenging religion on various issues. But if no creator exists, what kind of God?or religion?remains to discuss? The absence of a creator God does not necessarily imply the impossibility of other forms of divinity. Specifically, I have not disproven the existence of an infinitely powerful, knowledgeable, and loving God. I visualise this distinction clearly: a creator would exist 'outside the house of existence,' while any 'non-creator divinity' would inhabit this house alongside humanity.
Practically, people could still relate to or maintain faith in a supernatural being?admittedly less powerful but at least not logically impossible. Nonetheless, realising that God is not the creator inevitably raises significant questions about the validity of holy books, which unapologetically?and incorrectly?support creation.

Certainty
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
?Doubt is the origin of wisdom.??Ren Descartes

The core principles presented in this text emerged from the simple yet incessant question, "How can I be sure?" How can I be sure of my beliefs? How can I be sure about fundamental claims concerning God, the universe, and everything? Such questions have accompanied me for over two decades, unexpectedly dismantling my faith in God at the very beginning.
So, how can you be sure of your beliefs? How can you be certain that what you read in this book is true? If you are an extreme sceptic, you could doubt almost anything. You might even doubt that the air you breathe is really air, or that a glass of water before you is genuinely water. Yet, the following two chapters aim to provide even the most resolute doubter with the means to finally say, "This is true?I am sure of it," particularly regarding the concept of eternity and the role of God at the origin of existence. To achieve this, we must explore the hidden framework behind the 'eternal switch', demonstrating how it rests upon a linguistic and logical foundation that provides certainty beyond doubt. You may recall the claim in the book's Introduction that 'the proof begins with a simple yet profound concept: diversity'. Now, I will show precisely why this is the case. 
What is Certainty?
Certainty is the absence of doubt. Doubt (or uncertainty) is defined by the possibility that something could be different. For example, you might see an apple on a table and ask, "Could this not be an apple? Could it be something else?" If your answer is "yes," that possibility encapsulates your doubt.
In this text, we introduce two types of certainty: primary and secondary.ÿPrimary certaintyÿis defined by the absence of doubt, either due to the lack or dismissal of questioning. Before contemplating different possibilities, we exist in a state of naive assurance. For instance, when driving, you observe road signs, stay within your lane, and avoid other cars, all done in the unquestioned conviction that you truly are driving, and your surroundings are exactly as they appear. However, you could suddenly wonder, "Is this really a road? Am I truly driving?" The moment you entertain alternative possibilities, you transition from primary certainty into doubt. We typically live our daily lives without questioning whether the things we see, hear, and touch are real. By default, we feel sure rather than unsure about our experiences.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
But how can we regain certainty once doubt enters our minds?ÿSecondary certaintyÿis more challenging to achieve, as it involves addressing the specific questions that have caused doubt. It is defined by the explicit belief that something cannot be different. Put simply, if you ask, "Could this be something else?" and your answer is a definitive "no," you have reached secondary certainty. If you see an apple on the table and conclude it cannot possibly be anything other than an apple, you have achieved this type of certainty. But how can we ever arrive at such firm conclusions?
Why Aren?t We Sure?
To understand if absolute certainty is attainable, we must first recognise two primary sources of doubt: the communication of reality, and the experience of reality.
The Communication of Reality
A major source of doubt arises from our ability?or inability?to speak the truth, either to ourselves or to others. Truth, understood as 'speaking the truth', implies the correct communication of reality. To grasp fully what this means, we must examine the structure of communication by clarifying concepts such as 'definition', 'meaning', and 'label'.
Aÿdefinitionÿis the association of an experience with a label Any sign, symbol, or word represents the label component, while the associated experience provides its meaning (Figure 32).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 32: Structure of a Definition

Thus, any experience may or may not have an associated label. Without such association, it remains an unlabelled or nameless experience. Conversely, any label may or may not connect with an experience or meaning. Without such connection, it remains a meaningless word. For example, hearing words in an unfamiliar language results in perceiving meaningless words, as no experiences link to them (Figure 33).
Figure 33: Unlabelled Experience and Meaningless Word

Critically, we can give meaning to words by borrowing experiences from definitions we already possess. This occurs when learning a new language through translation?where the experience associated with a known word transfers to its foreign counterpart. For example, if you speak English, the word 'apple' evokes your experience of the fruit. Conversely, the Italian word 'mela' initially holds no meaning for you. Once you learn 'mela' translates as 'apple', the experience (meaning) transfers to 'mela'. Ultimately, all definitions rely on experience?either drawn from direct perception or borrowed through other words. A practical way to demonstrate this is to open a dictionary at random, select an unfamiliar word, and observe how its definition depends entirely on terms whose meanings you already understand.
Making a Definition
We can make a definition by associating a new experience?such as the sight of our newborn?with a previously selected name (Figure 34-A). Alternatively, we can associate a newly encountered word with a previously experienced event or object (Figure 34-B). In either scenario, once established, the definition can be memorised and subsequently employed in acts of communication (Figure 34-C).
Figure 34: The Making of a Definition

This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Teaching a Definition
A definition can be taught to someone else. For example, a teacher may show an apple to a class of schoolchildren, simultaneously presenting the word "apple" next to it (Figure 35).
Figure 35: Teaching a Definition

Using a Definition
More commonly, however, we are neither making nor teaching definitions; we simply use them. When we speak, listen, read, or write, we rarely need to learn from scratch the association between an experience and a label. Instead, we rely on labels alone to trigger the recall of previously memorised experiences, or vice versa. For example, we might recall the word "apple" upon seeing the fruit (Figure 36-A), or visualise the fruit when reading or hearing the word "apple" (Figure 36-B).
Figure 36: Using a Definition

Communication with others primarily works by sharing labels, which, when received, prompt interlocutors to recall previously memorised experiences or meanings. In Figure 37, the 'label sender' wishes to communicate his own experience of an apple (1). To initiate communication, he must have already memorised a definition (2 and 3), allowing him to recall the associated label (4). This label is then communicated (5) to the 'label receiver.' The receiver must similarly have a pre-existing memorised definition (7 and 8), enabling him, upon hearing the label (6), to consciously recall the associated experience (9).
Figure 37: Structure of Communication 

This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Miscommunication
In the previous example, both individuals shared matching definitions. However, miscommunication arises when participants' definitions differ. This might occur when speaking about colours to someone blind from birth (Figure 38-A) or, more commonly, when two people share the same word but recall differing experiences (Figure 38-B).
Figure 38: Structure of Miscommunication

Such mismatches typically arise during the definition-making process, and two primary scenarios illustrate this clearly. Suppose you and your friend are at school looking at the same green apple (Figure 39-A). Your friend, however, is distracted and mistakenly learns to label the green apple as 'red', while you correctly learn it as 'green'. Later, when discussing red apples, your friend visualises green apples due to this label mismatch. Alternatively, consider that both you and your friend pay close attention and correctly label a red apple as 'red' (Figure 39-B). Yet, because your friend is colour-blind, he mistakenly visualises these apples as green, causing an experience mismatch.
Figure 39: Causes of Miscommunication

Miscommunication also arises when we incorrectly recall a label from a previously memorised definition. For example, accidentally calling your child 'Ron' when his name is 'Ben' represents internal incongruence between your memorised definition and your current perception or thought of your child.
Speaking the Truth
Speaking the truth means communicating accurately?using words that align both with the reality being described (e.g., correctly calling your child ?Ben?) and with the shared definitions used by others to describe the same reality (e.g., everyone agreeing that red apples are indeed red apples).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
No Definition No Truth
Understanding the foundational mechanics of communication leads us to an essential conclusion: without definitions, neither truth nor falsehood is possible. This is because speaking truthfully requires using words aligned precisely with correct definitions. A word devoid of meaning cannot convey truth or falsehood. Likewise, applying a label to something or someone previously unnamed cannot constitute truthful or deceptive communication. For instance, when choosing a name for a newborn child, the chosen name itself is neither true nor false?it simply establishes a new definition.
The Experience of Reality
As we have just explored, truthful communication depends on various factors, including our ability to detect, interpret, recognise, remember, contextualise, and categoriseÿreality. These considerations lead us to the following discussion on howÿuncertaintyÿalso arises from the way we experience the world.
Dictionaries defineÿrealityÿas anything that is objective, factual, and therefore not just part of our imagination. However, there is a problem with this description. Normally, if we say that something is not real, we are saying that it is only fictional. So, when I claim that unicorns are not real, I imply that they only exist in my mind?or in people?s minds?but not outside them.
Surely, most of the time, the term ?real? is adequate when used as a synonym for ?objective?. However,ÿwhat if we ask the question, ?Is my imagination real??ÿWell, someone?s imagination still exists, and in this sense, it is real?even if it is not objective, but subjective.
So, it is perhaps more accurate to treat the notion ofÿrealityÿnot as a synonym for what isÿobjective, but, more broadly, as a synonym forÿthat which exists. Therefore, in this text,ÿrealityÿis defined not as the limited collection of objective and factual things beyond our mind, but as theÿset of all different things that exist, including our thoughts and feelings.
In other words, everything is real?either subjectively or objectively. To be clear,ÿobjective realityÿrefers to anything that exists outside our mind and happens independently from it, whileÿsubjective realityÿrefers to anything that exists inside our mind and happens because of it. This includes our thoughts and feelings.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Objective Existence Versus Objective Experience
There is an important difference between the expressionsÿobjective existenceÿandÿobjective experience. All our experiences are made conscious by our minds, within our minds, and are, therefore, all subjective?and never objective. In other words, anÿobjective experienceÿis impossible.
Nonetheless, we are able to distinguish between thoughts and bodies, which allows us to separate what we believe to existÿobjectivelyÿoutside our mind, such as a road, from what we believe to existÿsubjectivelyÿinside our mind, such as a unicorn.
At this point, it is worth clarifying how to categorise certain phenomena that may cause confusion. For example, are sounds and colours subjective or objective?
Consider a rock bathed in sunlight. The light bounces from it in the form of waves, some of which enter our eyes and brain, where they are eventually transformed into our conscious experience of colour. The colour of the rock isÿsubjective, as its existence depends on brain function and only happens within the mind. However, the light travelling from the sun to the rock and into our eyes isÿobjective, since its existence is assumed not to depend on brain function.
A similar distinction applies to sounds. Sound waves travel from one object to another, eventually reaching the brain, where they become audible experience. As with colours, the waves areÿobjective, but the experience of sound isÿsubjective.
Now consider the case of another person?s suffering. Is it subjective or objective? To answer this, the question must be rephrased:ÿDoes another person?s suffering exist outside our mind and independently from it?ÿIf the answer is yes, then the existence of their suffering isÿobjective. However, the experience of that suffering isÿsubjectiveÿto the person in pain, as it only happens within their own brain.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Are We Detecting and Interpreting Things Correctly?
There are times when we fail to discriminate between bodies and thoughts. Hallucinations, for example, may lead us to believe that what we are seeing isÿobjective, when in fact the experience is confined entirely to our mind. This raises the possibility that we may not always be able to categorise our experiences correctly?even at a fundamental level.
We could even consider the more radical possibility that everything we experience may always and only existÿwithinÿthe mind?from the sky above us to the chair we are sitting on. This would imply thatÿeverything is subjective, andÿnothingÿis objective. Such a scenario could occur if we are, in fact, living in aÿsimulation, in which our mind exists in a dimension beyond the reality we are perceiving.
In addition to hallucinations and the possibility of a simulation, there are many ways in which things can go wrong when we explore our surroundings?whether through our senses or with instruments. These issues can cause us to become sceptical, or uncertain, about what is real.
We cannot always rely on our own senses and thoughts. Imagine wearing glasses with green lenses?everything would appear different. In a similar way, our eyes and brain filter reality and alter how it appears to us. A colour-blind person, for instance, may not see red, and only experience green instead. The detection and interpretation of reality can be affected by a wide range of factors, including tiredness, distraction, drugs, trauma, or illness. All of these can impair both body and mind.
Nor can we always rely on someone else?s experience or opinion. The reliability of another person?s account is subject to the same fallibility of senses and mental states. People may be mistaken, affected by mental illness, or simply lying.
Even instrumental detection is not entirely reliable. To compensate for the limits of our body and mind, we often use devices such as cameras or sensors. But even these may be faulty or misused. A video can be manipulated. A photograph can be staged. A sensor can malfunction without our knowledge.
Experiments, too, are not infallible. Although experiments are designed to produce reproducible and predictable detections?either with or without instruments?there are usually many different ways to perform them. Each method may lead to different results or degrees of confidence in what has been observed.
Finally, even corroboration can fail us. Shared experiences are usually thought to be more trustworthy than individual ones. But entire groups may lie, or suffer from the same delusion, illness, or influence. Multiple instruments may also simultaneously produce inaccurate readings.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Belief and Evidence
Despite these limitations, we do rely on our senses, thoughts, and tools to navigate the world. And yet, because these systems can fail, we cannot be absolutely certain that we are detecting the world correctly or interpreting it reliably. If certainty is unreachable, then how can we function in life?
Reflecting on this question leads us to two related concepts:ÿbeliefÿandÿevidence. Whether the object on the table is truly a glass of water, the car outside is actually blue, or whether all of this is a simulation, the answer is always a matter ofÿlikelihood?that is, ofÿprobability. As mentioned earlier, most of us operate most of the time in a state ofÿprimary certainty. When we drive, for instance, we do not constantly question whether the traffic is a simulation.
However, once we begin to doubt what we are seeing, hearing, or feeling, we abandon our state of primary certainty and move into a state ofÿbelief. This state is based on what we judge to be more or less likely to be true.
Aÿbeliefÿis a mental posture defined by the expectation that carries the least degree of uncertainty. When someone says,ÿ?I believe the car is blue,?ÿthey are stating that their expectation that the car is blue is stronger than the opposite.
The notion ofÿevidenceÿis closely related to this. Here,ÿevidenceÿis defined as anything that is not someone else?s description of reality. It includes what we directly perceive?what we see, hear, or feel?whether aided by instruments or not.
Using this definition, we can distinguish between three kinds of belief: beliefÿbased on evidence, beliefÿwithout evidence, and beliefÿagainst evidence. If we see a car and believe there is a car, our belief is based on evidence. If we do not see a car but still believe there is one, the belief is without evidence. If we see a car and believe it is not there, the belief is against evidence. Figure 40 illustrates these relationships between evidence and belief.
Figure 40: Evidence and Belief

Furthermore, evidence can beÿpersonalÿorÿshared. Suppose you see an elephant walking down the street. Your visual perception of the elephant constitutes personal evidence. If you later tell your friends, it is not evidence for them?it is only your report. Shared evidence occurs when all of you see the same elephant.
Similarly, if you touch a piece of metal and feel intense heat, this is personal evidence that the metal is hot. But if others also touch it and report the same sensation, then it becomes shared evidence.
How to Be Sure
The purpose of this chapter is to validate the central claim made earlier: that creation never happened. This is no trivial assertion?it directly challenges deeply held beliefs, naturally inviting scepticism. Until now, this task may have appeared impossible, as we have constructed a case suggesting a life seemingly condemned to uncertainty. Our discussions so far have demonstrated that our capacity to experience and communicate reality is fraught with errors and limitations. These flaws constantly introduce doubt, often leaving us to rely either upon a nave sense of confidence or upon beliefs and probabilities. Given such uncertainties, how can anyone be absolutely sure about anything?particularly something as fundamental as God or the origin of existence?
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
A Meaning That Cannot Be Otherwise
Certainty begins with meaning. Firstly, if a word?s meaning aligns precisely with the reality it describes, we are speaking the truth. Secondly, and more importantly, if that meaning cannot logically be otherwise?if it necessarily is as we describe?then absolute certainty is achievable. Thus, the key to certainty is finding a meaning that could not possibly differ, a meaning that is universal and applies consistently across all of reality. Such a meaning, by definition, would remain accurate regardless of circumstance or perception. Before reading further, try to identify this meaning yourself. Look around and consider:ÿWhat can I confidently say about anything at all, knowing it will always hold true?
The universally true property is simply this:ÿdifference. Everything, without exception, differs in some way from something else. Your hand is different from this book, which is different from the wall, the door, and so forth. This remains true irrespective of whether we are dreaming, hallucinating, or fully awake. To say something is different does not require objective proof of existence?it requires only the presence of contrast with something else. Indeed, whenever you say something is different, you speak the truth. Can we be certain of this? Yes?because to imagine something not differing from anything else would be logically impossible. This insight is the cornerstone of certainty. From this universally truthful property?the fundamental fact ofÿdifference?we will build a series of logical claims. These claims, as we will see, are logically necessary, universally applicable, and incapable of being otherwise. 
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
What Is Logic?
Since we have used the expressionÿ?logically necessary,?ÿit is worth clarifying what we mean byÿlogicÿitself. To do so, we must begin with its opposite. One of the clearest ways to understand logic is by contrasting it directly withÿillogic?which leads us to a foundational question: what, precisely, constitutes illogic?
For instance, we readily recognise that aÿ?circular triangle?ÿis illogical?but what exactly does this mean? Illogic refers specifically to the formulation or communication of an impossible thought: a situation that arises when a single word or concept is asked to convey two mutually exclusive meanings at once. Although commonly described as a contradiction, this phenomenon represents something deeper?a breakdown in the very structure of thought. It is, in essence, a mental impossibility.
Consider, for example, the notion of aÿ?shape?ÿbeing used to represent both a triangle and explicitly something that is not a triangle, such as a circle. When attempting to form such a thought, the mind either stalls or shifts restlessly between incompatible meanings?triangle, non-triangle, triangle again?never achieving the expected shape.
This impossibility of thought due to contradiction reveals something fundamental: thought, and consequently language, is subordinate to unspoken reality. Language does not create a new reality by destroying ontological distinctions; it merely labels them, one by one. When we attempt to erase a difference through language?by denying it or treating opposites as identical?we do not succeed in eliminating the difference, but instead undermine the structure of thought. In this sense, the failure of thought becomes the failure of knowledge, and ultimately, the failure of language itself. Thus, the very definition of illogic reminds us that diversity exists prior to language.
Aÿlogical sentenceÿmay therefore be succinctly defined as any sentence entirely free from contradiction or impossible thought.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Certainty and Logic
Logic is intrinsically linked to certainty. The impossibility of mentally formulating contradictory thoughts?such as imagining a triangle that is, at the same time, not a triangle?is precisely what definesÿillogic. And it is this very impossibility that grounds our experience of certainty when we assert that a triangle cannot differ from itself.
The Argument from Diversity
TheÿArgument from Diversityÿis a cohesive framework comprising five fundamental claims, or 'pillars', derived directly from our model of eternity and the concept of theÿeternal switch (Table 4). Together, they support the central conclusion of this book: that creation never occurred and God is not the creator. The five pillars are as follows:
1. Diversity exists.
2. There is no third reality.
3. A first reality is one of equality.
4. A first reality is capable of change.
5. A first reality is unintelligent.
The analysis that follows will establish the validity of these propositions by demonstrating that if any of them were false, the resulting opposite claim would lead directly to contradiction or illogical thought.
First Pillar: Diversity Exists
Everything is different from something else. Even the negation of diversity reaffirms its existence.
The opposite claim is: ?Diversity does not exist.? Is this a contradiction? Yes. To deny diversity implies the existence of something different from diversity?namely, equality. But the word ?equality? is then being used to mean both ?a state different from diversity? and ?a state not different from anything?, which is illogical.
Any attempt to deny diversity inherently acknowledges difference, thus reaffirming diversity itself. Crucially, this pillar does not claim that diversity must always exist, but that any attempt to affirm or deny it already confirms its existence.
Second Pillar: There Is No Third Reality
Any known or unknown reality must be either different from diversity (i.e. equality) or not.
The opposite claim is: ?There is a third reality.? Is this a contradiction? Yes. A third reality would need to be different from both equality and diversity. But can anything be different from diversity without being equality? The thought of a reality that is neither diversity nor equality quickly collapses. The word ?third? is being asked to mean both ?outside the binary? and ?defined by the binary?, which is illogical. 
The impossibility of a ?third? reality has profound implications. If we ask, ?What?s beyond the duality?? or ?Who or what caused the duality??, we are effectively asking whether a third kind of reality could exist. But any state must be either different from diversity or not?there are no other options. Thus, ?beyond the duality? is not a deeper mystery?it is a structural impossibility. No logical escape exists, even for the fiercest sceptic.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Third Pillar: A First Reality Is One of Equality
If there is no infinite regress of different things, the only alternative is a starting point without diversity.
The opposite claim is: ?The first reality is one of diversity.? Is this a contradiction? Yes. A first reality implies no prior relation. But diversity, by definition, requires relation?between different things. If diversity began on its own, without relation, it would no longer be diversity. The claim tries to present diversity as both self-contained and relational, which is illogical. 
This pillar does not claim that a first reality must exist. The model of eternity?especially the Eternal Switch?allows for an infinite regress. However, if diversity ever stopped, the only alternative would be equality. Therefore, if there was a beginning, equality came first.
Fourth Pillar: A First Reality Is Able to Change
If equality could not change, only equality would exist?yet, diversity exists. Therefore, a first reality of equality must have changed.
The opposite claim is: ?A first reality is not able to change.? Is this a contradiction? Yes. If equality were permanently static, nothing else could ever have emerged. Yet diversity exists. So, the word ?equality? is being used to mean both ?unchanged sameness? and ?a sameness that transformed?, which is illogical. 
Put in the language of our model of eternity: the first reality must have been an equality of energy capable of becoming difference?not an equality of no energy, or absolute nothingness?by definition incapable of doing so. A change from nothing to something is not just improbable?it is structurally incoherent.
Fifth Pillar: A First Reality Is Unintelligent
Equality lacks awareness or self-awareness. It appears as nothing?to others and to itself.
The opposite claim is: ?The first reality is intelligent.? Is this a contradiction? Yes. Intelligence requires distinct thoughts?or at least a thought different from silence or invisibility. It requires difference. Even a uniform mental image?a monochrome field?has structural difference: same-coloured impressions existing side by side. A mind made of pure equality would have no structure, no awareness, and no awareness of awareness. It would be invisible to itself. A consciousness without content or contrast is not intelligence?it is the definition of unintelligent intelligence, which is as illogical as a green invisibility.
The implication of this final pillar is clear: if there ever was a beginning, there was no intelligence?only a mindless reality. Something all simple, yet all powerful. A state of undifferentiated energy of zero complexity.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Conclusion
The five pillars of the Argument from Diversity, drawn from the model of eternity, are rooted in pure logical necessity and the empirical undeniability that at least one difference exists. We can be certain of their truth because each claim cannot be otherwise without leading to contradiction, incoherence, or impossibility.
Radical scepticism may question even the air we breathe or the water we drink, dismissing them as illusions. But these five claims resist doubt because when we ask the ultimate question??Could it be different???the answer is no. It cannot be different?without becoming illogical. And this leads to one inevitable conclusion: Creation is necessarily impossible.

A philosophical stress test of these five pillars is included in the Appendix, offering those seeking deeper scrutiny a chance to further engage with the argument.

Certainty and Religion
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
?If you comprehend it, it is not God.??Saint Augustine
Certainty About God and Eternity
One of the most significant consequences of accepting the model ofÿeternityÿas true is that God cannot be the creator. Moreover, He cannot be theÿprime changer, either?because if there ever was aÿfirst reality, it could only be a state ofÿequality, not God. This is due to the fact that this type of reality is extremely simple (zero complexity) and does not allow for the presence of any kind of intelligence or design?characteristics of God.
Now, even in the absence of a logical refutation against this claim, some readers may still develop a protective sense of uncertainty around it, in order to avoid change. This often involves deploying a specific rational tool known asÿnegative theology, which works by placing God beyond the reach of language itself. However, as we will see next, the model ofÿeternityÿis immune to it.
Negative Theology
So, what isÿnegative theologyÿall about? This is the belief that God cannot be described in positive terms, such as "God is good" or "God is powerful", but only in negative ones?such as "God is unknowable", "infinite", "unspeakable", "supernatural", "otherworldly", or "beyond our understanding and beyond the reach of our language". This kind of approach to defining God works particularly well as a way to dismiss criticism, as it challenges the value of language rather than the logic of an argument. Specifically, someone might rebut with: "How can you say that God is not the creator orÿprime changerÿif nobody can know what the nature of God is?or even what the term 'God' means?in the first place?"
A Theology of Diversity
The key point to highlight is that a theology of negation is, in fact, implicitly also a theology of diversity. Bear with me. Let?s consider a chessboard (Figure 41). If you want to change the position of any piece, you could move it to a square that can be described as:
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
1. Not the current square
2. Beyond the current square
3. Different from the current square
4. 
Figure 41: Not, Beyond and Different

In practice, the act of negating implies referring to something beyond?but also different. This means that even the most negatively defined God is, ultimately, just different. So, even if God is unknowable, infinite, beyond our understanding or language, we can still describe Him as different. But why does this matter? Because now we are in a position to determine whether He can be different enough to occupy His unique place as the creator of everything?beyond the duality of existence.
No, God Is Certainly Not The Creator
Well, God cannot be different enough to be the creator of the duality, because?as previously established?diversity and equality are mutually exhaustive states of reality. To clarify: a God who is different from equality must belong to the realm of diversity, and vice versa. In either case, He remains within the duality, never transcending it?and therefore, never beyond it?making creation impossible. The simple question ?Who created the duality?? demands a reality outside, beyond, or different from the duality, which is impossible. Ultimately, even the most elusive interpretations of God?s nature, as proposed by negative theology, cannot escape the conclusion that creation is impossible?and therefore, it never happened.
No, God is Certainly Not The Prime Canger
Aside from the role of the creator of existence, another option would be that God is the first reality, or prime changer, existing eternally beyond space and time. This would match the non-religious definition of a reality of equality happening at the beginning of everything. In fact, negative theology is arguably the most supportive doctrine for a God that should be a state of equality. Let?s see how this is the case.
What is the most extreme negation? Nothingness. But what if God is intended to be more than just nothingness?what is the next most extreme negation? Equality of energy. Indeed, the only difference from nothingness is the presence of energy, meaning that it has the capacity to do work or change, while nothingness?or equality of no energy?does not. Otherwise, everything else about them is the same. They are both unimaginable, undetectable, without dimensions, identity, space, time, or limits (i.e. infinite)?all features that belong to the negative description of God.
However, if God is to be considered a state of equality, He must lose all the positive features that the rest of religion (positive theology) attributes to Him?including that of being an intelligent designer. Once again, a God capable of planning the creation of the universe is too complex to be an undifferentiated, dimensionless state of zero complexity?therefore, He cannot be the first reality or prime changer of existence. This argument stands, even if we claim that God is unknowable, beyond, or simply different. Indeed, if God is different from equality, He simply cannot be one?and if He is exactly one?that is, beyond space, time, and all that exists in the universe?then He cannot also be the master architect that religion wants Him to be.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Beyond Logic?
A final remark is needed regarding the claim that God exists beyond logic, which is, in fact, a meaningless proposition. For this claim to hold, it must itself belong to the realm of logical thought. In other words, only logic can meaningfully refute logic, making any attempt to undermine its validity inherently self-defeating.
The Religious Illusion of Certainty
While the Argument from Diversity demonstrates that absolute sureness can be reached by questioning the validity of its claims (i.e. secondary certainty), religious dogma asserts the same level of conviction without addressing the possibility that what it professes could, in fact, be different (i.e. primary certainty). This corresponds to nothing more than a nave sense of belief?one that thrives on avoiding doubt and dismissing questions altogether. In this sense, dogma is only the illusion of certainty.
Scientific and Religious Belief
Science is a belief system grounded in evidence?one that learns about reality directly from reality itself. Religion, by contrast, draws its knowledge indirectly from a book, assumed to be infallible. Thus, while a scientific text is revised when a better understanding of the world emerges, a religious one is never amended. Instead, when scripture conflicts with observable reality, its interpretation?rather than the text?is altered.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
The foundation of religious belief and dogma is the notion that scriptures are infallible: Why would you question something that cannot be wrong? This belief is often mistakenly sustained by the claim that their content is perfect. However, as we are about to explore in greater detail, perfection does not imply infallibility. The former belongs to the realm of discovery and evidence, while the latter remains an unsupported opinion.
The Scientific Discovery of Perfection
The word perfect comes from the Latin perfectus, meaning 'made complete'. Given its etymology, some may argue that complete is a synonym for perfect. However, consider this: two glasses are filled with water?one to the top, the other only three-quarters full. From which glass would you prefer to drink?
Some might find the full glass too full, as lifting it could cause water to spill. In this case, referring to a completely full glass as having the perfect amount of water would be misleading. This highlights a key insight: perfection requires a standard or expectation. If we define the perfect amount of water as three-quarters full, then a completely full glass is imperfect. Thus, something is perfect only when it fully aligns with a given standard. Without a defined standard, perfection is meaningless.
For instance, there is no perfect score in football, as no standard defines what that would be. However, in gymnastics, a perfect score is ten out of ten.
Evidence of Perfection 
Perfection is a scientific discovery in the sense that it is based on a match between a standard and evidence?whether it?s a gymnastic performance, a mathematical proof, or even an emotional reaction. A professor may mark an essay as faultless because it contains no spelling mistakes or aligns perfectly with their stylistic and conceptual expectations. In this case, perfection is determined both technically (i.e. no errors), and emotionally (i.e. it meets aesthetic standards).
Similarly, a holy book can be judged as perfect based on a neutral, technical standard?such as containing no grammatical errors or logical contradictions?or an emotional standard, meaning its content fully aligns with a person's aesthetic or moral expectations. Crucially, since moral and aesthetic standards are subjective, a holy book may be perfect to some but not to others.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
The Unsupported Religious Opinion of Infallibility
Yet, while perfection is measurable against a standard, infallibility makes a much stronger claim: that no error is even possible. But can this ever be supported? In other words, does perfect also mean infallible? The answer is no.
Imagine a clock that consistently shows the correct time. You might call it faultless?but does that make it infallible? No, because it could break at any time in the future. Infallibility requires the impossibility of error, whereas perfection simply means something aligns with a standard at a given moment. A gymnast may achieve a perfect score in an Olympic event, but this does not mean they will never make a mistake in future competitions. Similarly, an undefeated chess player could eventually lose a match.
This distinction applies to books as well. Unlike a clock, a book does not ?break? or ?stop?, making it seem more permanent. However, the evidence we use to evaluate it can change. Consider a book that states: The number of stars in the sky is odd. If current astronomical data supports this claim, we might call it perfect at that moment. But if a new star is discovered tomorrow, making the total even, the claim is no longer perfect?not because the text has changed, but because new evidence has altered our understanding of reality. Simply put, even a so-called perfect book cannot be considered infallible, because our knowledge evolves.
So, on what rational grounds do religious people claim that scriptures are always right?even when evidence contradicts them? The justification lies in the belief that God is an infallible author. But this raises a deeper question: How can you prove that God authored the book in the first place? If the response is, Because the text has no mistakes, then we have a circular argument: The book is infallible because God wrote it, and we know God wrote it because the text is infallible.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
To break this circular reasoning, we would need direct evidence of divine authorship. Many religious traditions claim that prophets received revelations from God. But here lies an insurmountable problem: How could a prophet verify that they were truly speaking with an all-knowing, infallible being?
The Impossible Evidence
Imagine you meet a mystical entity asserting to know everything. How could you test their claim? You might ask them a question?but you can only verify their answer if you already know the correct response. If you do not already possess absolute knowledge, you lack the necessary data to prove their omniscience and consequently confirm their infallibility.
Any prophet claiming divine authorship of a book faces the same limitation?they cannot verify the infinite extent of God's knowledge. Ultimately, only God can prove God, and since humans can?t reach and confirm omniscience, the belief that a text is divinely authored?and therefore infallible?remains an unsupported opinion.

Summary: The Religious Illusion of Certainty
Religious doctrines uphold their unchanging scriptures as superior to ever-evolving scientific texts?failing to recognise that this is not due to overcoming doubt, but to ignoring it. Believers may ask: Why trust something that could be proven wrong? Why not follow a text we believe to be infallible? Yet, this is precisely the problem. In rejecting scientific uncertainty, they replace it with their own unverified opinion?repackaged as ?faith?.
If, on the one hand, any scientific belief gains value by accumulating supporting evidence, it is unclear what makes a religious belief more valuable. More opinion? More belief? More faith? And what about the belief that something can never be wrong? Some argue, The proof is in the text?it has no mistakes. But even if a holy book were flawless in every claim, that would make it perfect, not infallible. Infallibility requires the impossibility of error, yet new evidence can always emerge?something science embraces, while dogma resists.
In the end, both science and religion acknowledge that human understanding can be flawed. The difference? Science adapts to reality. Religion asks reality to adapt to it. And if both belief systems can be wrong, why choose the one that begins farthest from reality?filtered through the interpretations of a text that has never been, and could never be, proven incapable of error?

Purpose
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
?The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.??Mark Twain
There are moments in life when something exceptionally tragic occurs, leaving us wondering what the point of it all is. We may look up at the sky in search of meaning?but find none. Or we might turn to those around us, only to feel more alone. A grave sense of loneliness can settle in. These are times when even the most glorious sunset or the warmest hug may fail to awaken in us a sense of worth or direction. Instead, we begin to question why we are here, and reflect that we all die in the end?destined to become a pile of ashes.
Yet the truth is that life is filled withÿpurpose. We simply need to recognise what it is made of, and how it works?so that in our darkest hours, ideas of nihilistic worthlessness do not compound our pain. And when a spark of hope or meaning does reach us, we are ready to acknowledge it, embrace it, and celebrate it.
To comprehendÿpurpose, we must explain why everything does what it does?that is, why it behaves in a certain way. In other words, we must understand the principles that guide the actions of people and of everything else.
To understand these principles, we must explore the meaning ofÿchoice, the nature ofÿself-consciousness, our sense ofÿgoodness,ÿbeauty, andÿmorality, and ultimately the idea ofÿvalue. In doing so, we will discover that these seemingly complex notions?includingÿpurposeÿitself?share a common denominator. A simple, and often unjustly understated, ingredient:ÿemotion.
Eventually, these various explorations will come together into a personal theory of everything?one in which we can begin to place our self-consciousness within the context of eternity. My hope is that, by the end of this chapter, we will have integrated the observations about behaviour and purpose that follow with those concerning the origin and end of existence discussed previously?thereby forming a unified framework.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
What is Purpose?
Let us begin by definingÿpurposeÿas the ?desired prospect, or predicted outcome, causing an action or event.? For example, if you were asked, ?What is the purpose of your holiday?? you might answer, ?To have fun,? or ?To see new places??responses that describe the desired prospect or predicted outcome prompting the action.
By contrast, unlike animals or people, most things in the universe?such as asteroids and stars?do not have a purpose, as they lack both the ability to predict and the capacity to desire. If we ask, ?Why did the rock fall on the house?? we expect a causal answer, not one framed in terms of intention.
In this text, aÿcauseÿrefers to anything without which something else could not occur. For example, gravity causes a rock to fall; gravity is a cause because, in its absence, the rock would not fall.
It follows that, to understand all types of behaviour?whether from people or rocks?we cannot limit ourselves toÿpurpose. We must broaden our view to encompassÿexplanation, seeking a more universal account of cause and effect (Figure 42). 
Figure 42: Model of Explanation of Behaviour

Behaviourÿis defined as any action or inaction carried out by a subject, and can be eitherÿunintentionalÿorÿintentional.ÿUnintentional behaviourÿis performed by subjects that do not choose to act?such as rain falling or wind blowing. By contrast,ÿintentional behaviourÿis performed by a subject who actively chooses to do something?such as a lion hunting a gazelle, or a person writing a letter.
To explain the behaviour of everything, we must explore these two types separately, examining their structure and underlying mechanisms. Once this is done, we will identify what they have in common, leading to a unifying explanation.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Unintentional Behaviour
Imagine a small rock at the top of a mountain. Wind and rain push it off a cliff, and gravity pulls it down into a valley, where it reaches a river. The river carries it to the sea, where it settles on the seabed. At no point has the rock moved because itÿchoseÿto move. Every change in its position results from interaction with its surroundings.
Now imagine a universe containing no sentient beings?no people, no animals?only stars and rocks. In such a case, all behaviour could be explained as a chain reaction of cause and effect, where every rock, star, molecule, and particle pushes and pulls on others, driving motion without intention Figure 43.
Figure 43: Model of Unintentional Behaviour

Intentional Behaviour
The universe, of course, is not merely a collection of rocks. It includes people, animals, and?so far as we know?perhaps many other forms of sentient beings in distant galaxies. Unlike a rock, aÿconscious beingÿcan evaluate different possibilities and choose a particular action or direction of movement.ÿIntentional behaviourÿis complex, and requires several essential components:
1. A conscious agent ? any subject withÿconsciousness
2. Experiences ? at least two options or experiences to choose from
3. Evaluation ? the process of assessing relevant factors associated with the available options
4. A choice ? the acknowledgment of a preference between two alternatives
We will examine each of these in turn, uncovering the underlying structure ofÿintentional behaviour. In doing so, we will also deepen our understanding ofÿpurposeÿitself.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
A Conscious Agent
Human beings are capable ofÿintentional behavioursÿbecause they areÿconscious. Therefore, the first step is to define the notion ofÿconsciousnessÿandÿself-consciousness. To do this, we will use the following thought experiment: imagine that you have an empty mind?as if you have never seen, heard, or felt anything, and remember nothing. From here, we begin gradually adding things, one by one, asking whether there is enough to define the terms ?self? and ?consciousness?. This process is similar to placing ingredients on an empty kitchen table and asking whether they are sufficient for a particular recipe.
By doing so, we observe how the mind is able to formulate increasingly complex concepts and definitions. The different levels of mental complexity we are about to examine are summarised in Table 5.
Table 5: Mind Levels

Mind Levels
Level 0 ? No Consciousness or Detection
At this level, the mind is empty: there are no experiences or memories (Figure 44-A). In such a state, can you define the word ?self?? No. Can you define ?consciousness?? No.
Level 1 ? Subconscious Detection
The eyes open. What is perceived can be described asÿvisual bodies,ÿdirect visual identities,ÿshapes, orÿcoloursÿ(e.g. Figure 44-B, showing a house and some trees). The skin begins to register temperature, touch, and pain. Similarly, the ears detect sound, and the joints sense position (proprioception). At this stage, all stimuli are processedÿsubconsciously?without the use of thoughts. For instance, your skin may detect heat and begin to sweat, yet unless you actively think about the sensation, you remain unaware of it.
Figure 44: From No Consciousness to Consciousness

Level 2 ? Simple Consciousness
Now the eyes close. If shapes and colours persist (Figure 44-C), they are defined asÿthoughts. If the eyes open again,ÿthoughtsÿandÿvisual bodiesÿcan be combined?for instance, the thought of a tree may appear in front of the real image of a house (Figure 44-D). Consciousnessÿis now the collection of such thoughts?about visual objects, sounds, or sensations. At this level, the mind can remember past experiences and consciously attend to present ones.
With the ability to reflect on thoughts, feelings, images, and sounds, the mind can begin to combine these experiences into progressively more complex forms. Two significant developments occur at the next level: the emergence of aÿfeeling-body consciousnessÿand the awareness of theÿmind itself. We will consider each of these in turn.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Level 3 ? Feeling-Body Consciousness
The mind continuously detects various bodies?trees, houses, clouds. At some point, two hands appear in the visual field (Figure 45-A), drawing the mind?s attention (Figure 45-B). One hand becomes associated with a warm sensation, while the other does not (Figure 45-C). This contrast prompts the mind to categorise theÿfeelingÿhand as distinct from those objects that are not linked to sensation (Figure 45-D). Gradually, moreÿfeeling-parts?such as the head, chest, abdomen, and legs?are recognised and integrated, giving rise toÿfeeling-body consciousness.

Figure 45: Feeling-Body Consciousness

Level 3 ? Mind Consciousness
The next cognitive leap is the mind?s awareness of its ownÿthoughts. At this stage, thoughts are recognised as a category separate from feelings and physical bodies. This realisation marks the beginning of a key distinction: theÿmindÿis now understood to be separate from theÿbody. But is this awareness alone sufficient to defineÿself-consciousness? Not yet. One more step is required?the integration ofÿmind awarenessÿwithÿfeeling-body awareness.
Level 4 ? Self-Consciousness
The mind now takes a significant step forward by combining its awareness of theÿfeeling bodyÿwith its awareness ofÿthoughts. For the first time, it is able to conceptualise the unity of a ?thinking-feeling body?. This is often symbolised by the idea of thoughts being located in theÿbrain (Figure 46). This advanced mental construct defines the widely recognised notion ofÿself-consciousness, or in more technical terms,ÿmind-feeling-body consciousness.
Figure 46: Self-Consciousness 

Why doesÿself-consciousnessÿonly emerge at this advanced stage? To answer this, we must ask:ÿHow does the mind know that anything is you or yours?ÿAt earlier levels, the mind simply observes bodies without associating them with feelings. This leads to further questions:ÿAre visual identities, bodies, or even thoughts enough to define you? Are they enough for the mind to distinguish between who you are and who you are not? The answer is no. Visual appearances alone are not sufficient for definingÿself-awareness. When two hands appear in the visual field, their shapes and colours are not enough to identify them asÿyourÿhands?whether you are simply looking at them (Figure 45-A) or thinking about them (Figure 45-B). The crucial missing element isÿfeeling.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
When a warm sensation is associated with one hand (Figure 45-D) the mind recognises a fundamental difference:ÿbodies that feel belong to me; bodies that do not feel belong to others. This rule applies universally?each person identifies theirÿfeeling bodyÿas their own.
However, if feeling were the only missing ingredient,ÿself-consciousnessÿwould already have emerged at Level 3. What remains is theÿthought of ownership. Level 4 is defined by the unique awareness that the mind is linked to the feeling body. This awareness enables the concept ofÿpossession?the ability to call a hand ?mine??and, ultimately, the ability to define oneself as an individual withÿthoughts,ÿfeelings, and aÿbody.
Level 5 ? Extended Self-Consciousness
Self-consciousness now extends to include non-feeling parts of the body that are physically connected to theÿfeeling body?such as muscles, fat, bones, and internal organs. This broader state is known asÿextended self-consciousness, as the definition of self is widened to include elements not directly linked to sensation.
However, this definition is not static. For example, nails or hair, once cut, are no longer perceived as part of the self, as they are no longer capable of evoking sensations like pain. Similarly, a person who loses feeling in a limb may still regard it as part of their identity, owing to its physical connection to the rest of the body.
Level 6 ? Others? Self-Consciousness
At this level, the mind recognises that other bodies?beyond its own?are capable of feeling and thinking, even though their experiences cannot be directly accessed. This marks the awareness of a fundamental distinction betweenÿsentientÿandÿnon-sentientÿsubjects (i.e. between people and rocks).
There may be alternative ways to categorise the progression from subconscious detection to fullÿself-consciousness. Nevertheless, the purpose of Table 5 is to demonstrate that such a progression does indeed exist, and that bothÿconsciousnessÿandÿself-consciousnessÿarise from the cumulative detection ofÿthings,ÿfeelings, andÿthoughts.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Labelling Differences
You may have noticed that each level of the mind emerges when aÿnew differenceÿis detected. Initially, there is no difference?hence no consciousness. When the first elements ofÿdiversityÿappear, the mind begins its journey.
The first distinction arises among objects or bodies, and separately, among feelings. This is followed by differences between thoughts, and then the more complex recognition of feeling bodies as distinct from those that do not feel. Next comes the awareness of thoughts as separate from all other experiences. Finally, the mind perceives the unity of a feeling body and its thoughts, distinguishing it from all other bodies.
Every word we use is ultimately defined by the recognition of a difference?and the labelling of its two parts, orÿdiffs. This holds true for everything we experience, including the experience of our own identity (seeÿEternityÿchapter).
A Broader Definition of Consciousness 
Consciousnessÿmay not be the exclusive prerogative of human beings?or even of complex animals. It could, in principle, arise in less conventional forms, such asÿmachines.
Consider a video camera that detects a change in its surroundings upon being switched on. This process might be compared to a human being opening their eyes, corresponding to the subconscious detection ofÿvisual identitiesÿ(Level 1). If the camera stores the detected images in its circuitry, this could be likened to ourÿvisual thoughts. Of course, a camera?s stored images and a human?s thoughts are structurally and qualitatively distinct?yet both represent something that has beenÿdetected. In this limited sense, a camera might be said to possess a kind ofÿdigital consciousnessÿ(Level 2).
Importantly, however, the camera does not possessÿawarenessÿ(Level 3)?it neither reflects on its own thoughts nor is aware of anyÿfeeling parts. It lacks a unified sense of body or mind.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Now consider a thermostat. Doesn?t it detect heat, and in that sense, ?feel? it? Perhaps. But this does not mean the thermostat is aware of its own body.ÿFeeling-body consciousnessÿrequires more than detection?it requires the ability to link sensory input (e.g. heat) to a specificÿpartÿof the device in order to build the identity of aÿfeeling body. The thermostat does none of this.
That said, a more advanced machine might, in principle, attainÿfeeling-body awareness. Yet even then, much more would be needed forÿself-consciousness. The machine would have to develop awareness of its ownÿmind, and integrate that with awareness of itsÿbody. Only then could it conceptualise itself as aÿthinking-feeling body?the core definition ofÿself-consciousnessÿ(Level 4).
The next section will return to a focus onÿhumanÿconsciousness in the context ofÿintentional behaviour. This will be followed by a discussion on whether other sentient beings?or even machines?might be capable of deliberate action in ways comparable to humans.
Experiences
Intentional behaviour cannot occur without at least two things to choose from. Or to put it very simply?it is not possible to choose between two apples if we cannot first think of two apples. So, the next step is to explore the notion ofÿexperience, which refers to anything associated with our self-conscious body.
Experiences can be categorised asÿindirect?that is, our thoughts?andÿdirect, which includes all others distinct from our thoughts. These may be further classified asÿaudio-visualÿandÿnon-audio-visual, including ourÿsensationsÿandÿemotions. Physical sensations are those associated with the skin (touch, temperature, pain), limbs and joints (proprioception), mouth (taste), and nose (smell).ÿEmotionsÿinclude all the feelings that are not physical sensations?such as happiness, sadness, anger, and so on. One might also includeÿspiritualÿorÿsupernatural experiences. In such cases, readers may determine their preferred way of categorising these and incorporate them into Table 6.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Table 6: Direct and Indirect Experiences

There are not only various types of experiences but also differingÿintensitiesÿwithin each type. When we look directly at the sun and then at a candle, we perceive lights of different intensities. When we hear someone shouting and someone whispering, we hear sounds of different intensities. If we place our hand beside a lit candle and then above the flame, we feel different degrees of heat. Likewise, learning that a cat caught a mouse and that a friend has gone missing may produce emotional responses of different strengths. Emotions can also be broadly categorised asÿpositiveÿandÿnegativeÿ(see Figure 47).
Figure 47: Positive and Negative Emotions

Experiences are rarely isolated in the mind. More often, they interconnect?forming ourÿthought process. Importantly, thoughts may connect to emotions. For instance, we may think about an exam in two days and associate that thought with a negative emotion. Alternatively, we might daydream about an upcoming holiday and associate that thought with a positive feeling. Table 7 illustrates how different types of experiences may become associated with positive or negative emotions.
Table 7: Different Types of Associations With Emotions

This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
At this point, it is helpful to highlight a linguistic concern. The common termÿthought processÿfails to capture the emotional associations that often accompany our thoughts. For this reason, this work adopts the expressionÿthought-feeling processÿinstead.
The most basicÿthought-feeling processÿinvolves the association of one experience with one emotion. This might be the taste of coffee linked with the emotion of enjoyment (Figure 48-A). As more experiences and emotions become involved, the process becomes more complex. For instance, coffee may remind us of a specific memory?such as being in a caf with someone?which in turn connects with the memory of other emotions experienced that day (Figure 48-B). With further reflection, we might recall meeting other people and the feelings involved in those encounters, making the process even more intricate (Figure 48-C).
Figure 48: Thought-Feeling Process

As we shall see, the connection between experience and emotion shapes our very notion ofÿgoodness?including our sense of beauty and morality. This is essential for our ability to evaluate and choose between options. In fact, when we make a choice, we are ultimately expressing a preference between what we perceive as good, bad, better, or worse.
Let us now examine the definition ofÿgoodness, and how it relates to our thoughts and emotions. Three distinct types of goodness are introduced here:ÿaesthetic,ÿempathic, andÿorthotic.
Aesthetics 
Aesthetics, or theÿaesthetic sense, refers to our perception of beauty, taste, or art. It is fundamentally rooted in our emotional responses to sensory stimuli. This applies to audio-visual experiences?such as paintings or music?as well as to sensations like taste and smell.
For example, after trying several types of food, could you determine which one tastes best without an emotional response? The answer is no. Likewise, when observing paintings or listening to music, can you judge a beautiful piece from a less beautiful one without emotion? Again, the answer is no. Aesthetic perception is inherently emotional, shaping our judgements of what is pleasing and what is not (Table 8).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Table 8: Aesthetics

To be more precise, the emotional response can be referred to as ourÿsenseÿof beauty, while the stimulus (e.g. a song) is theÿsubjectÿof beauty (Figure 49). Moreover, aesthetic experiences may beÿdirect?such as the sight of a sunset?orÿindirect?such as the thought of a sunset.
Figure 49: Aesthetic Experience

Empathics
In this context, anÿempathic experienceÿrefers to the association of emotional responses?positive or negative?with other emotions, whether our own or those of others. For instance, we may either enjoy or dislike the feeling of anger.
As with aesthetics, empathic experience involves both aÿsubjectÿand aÿsenseÿof empathy, and may beÿdirectÿorÿindirect (Figure 50). We experienceÿdirect empathyÿwhen we emotionally respond to visible signs of emotion?such as a smile or tears. We experienceÿindirect empathyÿwhen we respond emotionally to thoughts about what another person may be feeling, even in the absence of any visible cues.
Empathic experiences may thus range from instinctive reactions to more reflective, considered responses, depending on the emotional associations involved.
Figure 50: Empathic Experience

Orthotics
Not all types of goodness depend on emotion. In fact, the termÿgoodÿis often used as a synonym forÿcorrect. To be correct means to conform to a given standard or expectation. For instance, the spelling of a word may be correct if it matches the version found in a dictionary.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Here, we introduce the notion ofÿorthoticsÿorÿorthotic goodness, from the Greekÿorthos?meaning 'upright', 'straight', or 'not crooked', and thus, 'correct'. Unlike aesthetic and empathic goodness,ÿorthotic goodnessÿdoes not rely on any emotional reaction. For example, checking a word?s spelling is a matter of visual comparison, requiring no emotional involvement (Figure 51).
Nonetheless, we may respond emotionallyÿafterÿverifying correctness. We might dislike the look of a misspelt word, even if we recognise it as incorrect. This demonstrates that whileÿcorrectnessÿdoes not depend on emotion, our response to correctness?or incorrectness?can still be emotional.
An exception arises when we are comparing emotionsÿthemselvesÿto a standard. In such cases, we may determine that a particular emotional reaction is appropriate or 'correct'?an orthotic judgement applied to feeling.
Figure 51: Orthotic Experience

Behavioural Goodness
Like anything else, our behaviour may be judged aesthetically,ÿempathically, orÿorthotically?but let us clarify what this means.
The movement of dancers on a stage, or the flight pattern of a flock of birds, may be aesthetically good or bad depending on whether we perceive it as beautiful or ugly. A behaviour may also be empathically good or bad if it elicits an empathic response. For example, if we witness someone hitting another person, we may respond empathically and judge the behaviour as bad because we dislike the suffering it causes. Conversely, seeing someone give food to a poor elderly man may be judged as good because we appreciate the happiness it brings.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Finally, a behaviour may also be orthotically good or bad?that is,ÿcorrectÿorÿincorrect?if it aligns with a standard or expectation, such as rules or regulations. Athletes who act outside the rules of their sport commit a foul. Similarly, in society, those who act outside the law commit a crime. Whether in a sporting context or in wider society, behaviour is judged correct or incorrect according to the relevant rules, laws, or instructions.
Morality 
Moral judgement, or morality, refers specifically to our empathic response?rather than an aesthetic or orthotic one?to certain choices of behaviour. For example, while dancing or singing in a particular way may be judged aesthetically, the choice to feed or not to feed the poor may be considered moral or immoral.
Importantly, morality does not refer to choices driven solely by our own emotional state (i.e.ÿself-empathic). For instance, deciding to alleviate one's own suffering may be considered good, but not necessarily moral or immoral.
Moreover, while morality is often associated with behaviour, we are in fact judging theÿchoiceÿbehind the behaviour, not merely the act itself. The same action, if not the result of a choice, may be deemed bad but not immoral. Suppose an asteroid destroys planet Earth. We may call the outcome bad, but we would not call the asteroid?s actionÿimmoral?because the asteroid does not choose its own path. However, if a scientist deliberately manipulates the asteroid?s trajectory to cause destruction, theirÿchoiceÿmight be described as immoral.
That said, morality does not apply to all choices?it pertains only to a specific sub-category of behaviour in which the evaluative process is assumed to be sufficientlyÿcomplex. For instance, if a dog attacks a person, we may consider the behaviour bad, but not immoral, because the dog acts on instinct. Similarly, when a young child hits someone, we typically do not attribute immorality due to the limited complexity of their mental processes. In contrast, when a healthy adult attacks someone, we often assume a higher degree of cognitive deliberation and may therefore judge the behaviour as immoral.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 52: Moral, Immoral or Neither?

In summary, as illustrated in Figure 52, morality is defined by ourÿempathic responseÿto behaviour that stems from aÿchoice?provided that the choice is made through a sufficientlyÿcomplex thought process.
Right and Wrong
The termsÿrightÿandÿwrongÿrefer specifically to good and bad behaviour?whether judgedÿaesthetically,ÿempathically (including moral judgements), orÿorthotically. For instance, you might prepare a meal for your partner, who may say itÿtastes right?an aesthetic judgement. Alternatively, they might say you did something right in an orthotic sense, acknowledging that you followed the recipe correctly. Or they may commend you for doing something right empathically, recognising your intention to provide comfort after a difficult day.
Evaluation
Up to this point, we have established that intentional behaviour is only possible when a person is exposed to at least two options or experiences from which to choose. We then classified these experiences and examined how they shape our sense of goodness?including beauty and morality. We now turn to how these experiences converge to form ourÿevaluation process, which ultimately guides our choices.
The first key insight is that any act ofÿevaluationÿis composed of bothÿthoughtsÿandÿemotions. The word evaluation means ?to find value?, andÿvalueÿitself is defined by our emotional responses. Aÿpositive emotionÿindicates a positive value, and aÿnegative emotionÿindicates a negative value. Furthermore, values may be ranked higher or lower depending on theÿintensityÿof the associated emotion (Figure 53).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Figure 53: Value

To ?find the value? of something means to identify or acknowledge the emotion we associate with a particular experience. For example, a shirt may have been inexpensive but still hold significant value if it is emotionally meaningful. If it once belonged to someone you loved, it might become a cherished object.
The evaluation process may beÿsimpleÿorÿcomplex, depending on how many factors are involved (Figure 54). Consider how many associations may connect to a single object?such as a shirt. A simple evaluation might involve liking the shirt?s colour or shape. A more complex evaluation could include a memory of your father wearing the shirt, contributing further emotional value. Yet another layer might be added if the shirt is made by a brand you dislike due to unethical manufacturing practices?adding a negative value.
Figure 54: Evaluation?Simple to Complex

Life often presents us with challenging situations requiring complex evaluation. For instance, if you are a doctor, would you offer or deny a risky intervention to a dying patient? If you are the parent of a child who has committed a violent crime, would you report them? If you are a political leader, would you legalise a controversial substance? The answers to such questions are shaped by aÿthought-feeling processÿinvolving many interconnected considerations?such as the right to life, freedom, personal loyalty, respect for institutions, and more.
Nonetheless, regardless of complexity, every evaluation is ultimately the result of experiences connected to emotions. These experiences form distinct structures in the mind, made up of specific combinations that are worth classifying. As illustrated in Figure 55, we can divide the elements of an evaluative process intoÿprimaryÿandÿsecondaryÿsubjects.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Figure 55: Structure of Evaluation

Theÿprimary subjectÿis the object or event that initiates the evaluative process?for example, the shirt.ÿSecondary subjects are all the other factors associated with the primary one, such as the memory of your father or the shirt?s brand. Each subject may connect to its own emotion and therefore carry its ownÿvalue.
Theÿprimaryÿorÿessential valueÿis the emotional response elicited directly by the primary subject, without association with any other elements. For instance, you might like the shirt simply because of its colour or design. In contrast,ÿsecondaryÿorÿadded valueÿarises from emotional responses to secondary subjects, which can be further categorised asÿderivedÿorÿconsequential, depending on how they relate to the primary subject.
Derived valueÿis the emotional response to a secondary subject from which the primary one derives or depends. For example, if the shirt was given to you by your father, then its added value is derived from that emotional connection.ÿConsequential value, by contrast, is the emotional response to a secondary subject that results from or depends on the primary one. Suppose your skin has become sunburnt after a day at the beach; you may value the shirt because it provides protection. In this case, the value stems from the consequence of its use.
Choice
An act ofÿevaluationÿleads to aÿchoice?that is, the acknowledgement of a preference between two or more options. Technically, a choice requires at least two emotional responses of differing intensities to two distinct options (Figure 56). For example, when deciding between two shirts, we tend to select the one that elicits the stronger positive emotional reaction. In other words, the subject of choice is, by definition, the one associated with the greater positive emotion?the shirt weÿwantÿthe most.
Figure 56: Structure of a Choice 

For a choice to occur, each option must be individually evaluated and compared?a process that can range from simple to complex. When deciding between a green and a pink shirt, you might glance at the colours and register an immediate preference. Alternatively, you may reflect more deeply, considering how each shirt complements your wardrobe. If you were a fashion designer, your evaluation might involve a much broader set of criteria before settling on a final preference (Figure 57).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 57: Complexity of a Choice

Reflex, Instinct and Intention
Some events in life, particularly those that are sudden and unexpected, do not allow us the time to evaluate options and make a deliberate choice. For example, if you are suddenly attacked by a dog, you might scream out of fear. In such cases, behaviour follows directly from emotion, without the evaluative step of asking,ÿShould I scream or not? This is an example of anÿinstinctiveÿaction?behaviour driven by emotion, absent the comparison of alternatives.
For completeness, we must also considerÿreflexes. Unlike instinctive and intentional actions, aÿreflex bypasses both thought and emotion. It is a direct physiological response. For instance, if someone taps the tendon just below your kneecap while you are seated, your leg will kick forward automatically, following activation of a peripheral neural circuit. This action does not involve the mind at all (Table 9).
Table 9: Complexity of Behaviour

Direction of Behaviour
Because emotions define our preferences and choices, they also determine the direction of our behaviour. Emotions tell us what we value, what we like or dislike, what we consider good, bad, beautiful, ugly, moral, or immoral. As such, they influence what we are drawn to?or repelled by.
A positive emotion may be strong enough to move usÿtowardsÿsomething. In this case, we speak ofÿemotional attraction. Conversely, a negative emotion may be strong enough to move usÿawayÿfrom something?what we callÿemotional repulsionÿ(Figure 58).
Figure 58: Emotions and Direction 

Most of the time, we are not moved by a single emotional response triggered by a single thing, but by a combination of multiple factors. Each primary and secondary subject may carry its own emotional connection, contributing to a general pull or push. Moreover, we often have mixed feelings about a subject, or feel similarly about two distinct options. In such cases, it is helpful to classify our choices as:ÿall-positive,ÿmixed, orÿall-negativeÿ(Figure 59).
Figure 59: All-Positive, Mixed or All-Negative Choice

This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Anÿall-positive choiceÿoccurs between two things that both elicit positive emotions?such as choosing between two songs you enjoy. You feel drawn to both, but more strongly to one.
Aÿmixed choiceÿinvolves one option that triggers a positive emotion and another that triggers a negative one?choosing between a song you like and one you dislike. You are drawn to one and repelled by the other.
Anÿall-negative choiceÿarises when both options provoke negative emotions. Here, you choose the lesser of two evils. For example, imagine standing at the top of a burning tower. Would you jump or remain where you are? Neither option is desirable, but you must act?choosing based not on what youÿwant, but on what you least want to endure.
Such situations reveal that our choices are not always directed by attraction. Sometimes, the most intense negative emotion?such as fear?drives us to act. At other times, a more reflective calculation, such as the hope of avoiding the worst possible outcome, may be the deciding factor.
Wrapping It Up With Two Thought Experiments 
Now that we have examined the structure of intentional behaviour?particularly the processes of evaluation and choice?let us consider two thought experiments to see how these elements come together in practice.
As you work through them, try to distinguish betweenÿprimaryÿandÿsecondaryÿsubjects. Observe how each triggers emotional responses and contributes to overallÿvalue, guiding your preference or decision.
In the first experiment, imagine that there are five faulty mixers. Four contain living things, and the fifth contains a precious object (Figure 60). These mixers could activate at any moment, so you must decide in which order to rescue the subjects.
Figure 60: First Experiment of Evaluation and Choice

Different people may make different choices. One person might save the plant before the snake; another might do the opposite. Your choice depends on the overall value you assign to each subject. For example, suppose the precious object is a shirt that a billionaire is willing to pay a fortune for?provided it is not damaged. The shirt?s value to you may increase dramatically?not just due to its appearance (primary value), but due to the immense financial gain it offers (secondary, consequential value). In this case, would you prioritise the shirt over the plant, the dog?or even the child?
In the second scenario, the faulty mixers now contain different human subjects and a dog (Figure 61).
Figure 61: Second Experiment of Evaluation and Choice

You might begin with the view that all humans are equally valuable. But as you evaluate more deeply, you may consider distinctions between a baby, a teenager, and an older person. The evaluation becomes even more complex with the introduction of secondary factors. Perhaps the man is your brother, or the older woman knows the cure for cancer. Or maybe you are guided by a moral principle such as "Never kill a child." If that rule outweighs all other considerations?even the potential cure for cancer?you might let the woman die first.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

In summary, thoughts and emotions work together to define our judgements, enabling us to carry out both aesthetic and moral evaluations, regardless of the complexity involved.
Hierarchy of Values
These experiments reveal that some subjects are more valuable to us than others. For example, we may value the life of a child more than that of a snake. Our ability to respond with differing emotional intensities to different experiences leads inevitably to the formation of aÿhierarchy of values.
Any diverse group of things can be categorised and ordered based on different criteria. For example, vehicles could be ordered by size, speed, age, and so on Figure 62.
Figure 62: Hierarchy of Subjects by Size

When subjects are ordered specifically by the intensity of the emotion they evoke, the resulting structure is referred to as aÿhierarchy of values. A group of vehicles could be ordered according to how much we like each one, from most to least (Figure 63).
Figure 63: Hierarchy of Values

In any hierarchy of values, the subject associated with the strongest emotional response?positive or negative?is, by definition, the most valuable or dominant one. Our evaluations, and ultimately our choices, are conditioned by these hierarchies. When we choose, we do so in accordance with what we value the most. Figure 64 illustrates an example of such a hierarchy, with the most emotionally dominant factor placed at the top.
Figure 64: Hierarchy of Life Values

Ultimately, each of us lives by a unique hierarchy of values. Our decisions and life directions are often shaped by factors that are dominantÿto us?but not necessarily shared or prioritised by others. Consider the following examples.
Sarah grew up in a low-income household. Her parents worked tirelessly to support her education, often at great personal sacrifice. As a result, she developed a deep sense of gratitude and aspired to give back. One day, she plans to buy her father the sports car he has always admired but could never afford. Her gratitude becomes a dominant force in her life.
Phil is a young footballer who has moved abroad to play for a professional team. He trains intensively every day, enduring pain and isolation. Yet, when he suffers, he visualises himself scoring goals in front of thousands of cheering fans. The dream of success and recognition becomes the prevailing motivation in his life.
Mel has a terminal illness with no current cure. However, she learns about an experimental drug that might save her. Since discovering it, the thought of recovery dominates her emotional world. Her hope for restored health becomes the most valuable force in her experience.
Harry lives on an Earth conquered by a violent alien civilisation. In the heart of their fortress lies a red button?if pressed, the aliens will leave, and humanity will be free. The desire for freedom and the drive to reach that button define your life's direction.
Finally, Ron is deeply religious. He believes that by following divine commandments, he will attain a beautiful, eternal afterlife. The hope of heaven?and the commandments themselves?become central to his life?s hierarchy of values.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Meaning and Purpose
Emotions do not merely contribute to our evaluations and choices by shaping our sense of beauty and morality?they also define ourÿsense of purposeÿandÿmeaning. What we consider valuable in life?health, wealth, success, freedom, or even the hope of eternal life?are all examples of emotionally charged goals to pursue. In other words, they are examples ofÿpurpose.
When we make a decision, we choose the option that carries the greatest value and offers the strongest sense of purpose?meaning, the one that triggers the most dominantÿpositiveÿemotional response. More technically, theÿemotionÿwe feel corresponds to theÿsenseÿof purpose, while the thing we are drawn to?such as a family, a cause, or a career?is theÿsubjectÿof purpose (Figure 65). This recalls our earlier definition ofÿpurposeÿas the desired prospect, or predicted outcome, that causes an action or event. Here, the outcome?such asÿhaving a family?is theÿsubject, while the desire?the associated emotional pull?is theÿsenseÿof purpose.
Figure 65: Structure of Purpose or Meaning

Given what we have now seen about the central role of emotions, we may reach a simple yet profound conclusion: life is rich with meaning and purpose so long as it is rich with emotion. There is none in the core of a star or in the emptiness of space?but there is in our hearts, which, with each beat, knock at the door of our mind, offering meaning?whether we hear it or not.
People find purpose in different ways. Some discover it in the small details of everyday life; others pursue it through grand ambitions. Some chase wealth, others seek companionship. Some are drawn to art, others to science. Some long to be immersed in nature, while others find solace in technology. When we are in love, everything seems to have purpose?even a grey, rainy day can feel beautiful.
By contrast, those who feel hopeless or disconnected from the future may struggle to experience emotions strong enough to declare, ?My life has purpose.? When emotional responses become dulled, a happy smile feels less happy, a joke less funny. Eventually, when we stop responding positively to life, we lose our sense of meaning. Everything begins to feelÿworthless?lacking value.
In such moments, our sense of purpose may no longer arise from within, as our thoughts repeatedly fail to connect with any positive emotion. It may rely instead on someone else?a friend, a family member, or the kindness of a stranger?who lifts us up and helps us rediscover the possibility of feeling something beautiful, good, and meaningful once again.

Other Agents of Intentional Behaviour
So far, we have focused on howÿhuman beingsÿevaluate options and choose behaviours. It is relatively uncontroversial to say that animals?such as monkeys, dogs, and other mammals?are alsoÿagentsÿcapable of deliberate action. Like humans, they perceive their environments and respond emotionally to them. Through experience, they develop preferences and act accordingly.
Thus, the fundamental difference between human and animal decision-making does not lie in the ingredients involved?thoughts and feelings?but in theÿcomplexityÿof evaluation leading to behaviour.
This brings us to a more contentious question:ÿWhat about machines?ÿAre they capable of making choices?
If a machine can detect sufficient information, store at least two distinct options in memory, and respond with a digital equivalent of emotional reaction?such as a positive or negative feedback signal?then, in a fundamental sense, even machines can make choices. The greater their data-processing capacity, the more complex their evaluations become.
However, only a machine capable of achieving the highest level ofÿself-consciousness?that characteristic of human beings?could exhibit a level ofÿintentional behaviourÿcomparable to ours. Specifically, such a machine would need to form emotional orientations towardÿitself?that is, feel attraction or repulsion regarding its own existence. This would mark the emergence of a fundamental drive forÿself-preservationÿorÿself-destruction. In addition, it would need to emotionally respond to its awareness of other sentient beings?particularly humans?in order to determine whether itÿwishesÿto protect or eliminate them.
A Unifying Explanation
Now that we understand how intentional behaviour works, we can compare it with unintentional behaviour and offer a unifying account. Both share two key features: the presence ofÿattractive and repulsive forcesÿand the occurrence of aÿchain reaction.
Attraction and Repulsion
In both the natural and intentional realms, attractive and repulsive forces govern behaviour. In the physical world, gravitational, nuclear, and electromagnetic forces determine the movement of stars, rocks, and machines. Similarly, in the human mind, emotional forces?positive and negative responses?determine behaviour (Figure 66).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 66: Attraction With or Without Emotions

Chain Reaction
A second common denominator is the presence ofÿchain reactions. A sequence of interconnected events?such as wind moving a rock, which then rolls into another rock and eventually falls into a river?is a simple example of physical causality. Machines operate similarly: a chain of electrical impulses produces complex actions in devices like cameras or phones. More advanced machines may digitally evaluate and choose actions via even more elaborate series of interrelated changes.
Likewise, the process of evaluation and decision-making in our minds can be understood as aÿchain of cause and effect. Our thoughts and emotions?leading to specific choices?are ultimately shaped by a causal sequence.
Choices Within a Chain Reaction
Before we continue, it is helpful to address a potential ambiguity regardingÿhuman consciousness. For example, scientists have found that the human immune system can ?remember? previous viruses and bacteria. This ability?to recognise and respond to previously encountered threats?suggests a kind of ?memory? and ?intelligence?, raising questions about what consciousness entails.
To avoid confusion, the termsÿconsciousness,ÿmind, andÿmemoryÿin the following discussion will refer exclusively to processes governed by ourÿthoughts. The termÿnon-conscious bodyÿwill refer to all functions and systems not defined by thought?including the immune system.
Consider this example: if you prick your finger, a signal is generated in the nerve endings. This signal travels to the brain, which transforms it into theÿconscious experienceÿof pain. That pain may then activate the endocrine system, triggering the release of hormones such as cortisol or adrenaline. These in turn interact with the brain, intensifying emotions like fear. Finally, theÿcombined emotional experienceÿof pain and fear may guide you to pull your hand away.
In this example, we observe a chain reaction beginning with an external stimulus, travelling through subconscious pathways, and culminating in aÿconscious decision. We may represent the relationship between subconscious and conscious experience with the analogy of the ocean and the sky (Figure 67).
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Figure 67: Consciousness and Subconsciousness 

Any stimulus?whether external or internal?can bring unconscious content to the surface. These may include what we callÿsubconscious memories,ÿthoughts, orÿemotions. To illustrate this mechanism, let us consider three brief examples.
Imagine being asked to think of a yellow thing. This simple prompt may surface the image of a yellow object that had been quietly swimming in your subconscious?unnoticed, but present. Now, consider being asked to focus on a sensation in your feet. You may suddenly become aware of a particular feeling?such as warmth, discomfort, or pressure?that existed beforehand but entered consciousness only after being directed to it. Finally, if you are asked to think about your emotions, you may begin to notice a range of feelings within you?states not constantly active in your awareness, yet still accessible.
These exercises demonstrate how thoughts and emotions arise from the dynamic interplay between subconscious content and conscious focus?triggered by language, experience, or reflection. They also reinforce the central theme of this chapter: that human decision-making, and the experience of purpose, are not spontaneous or mysterious. They are the result of vast and interconnected chains of causality?rooted in emotion, memory, and the logic of choice.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Subconscious Jump
In this text, we define the specific moment when something rises from the subconscious into conscious awareness as aÿsubconscious jumpÿ(Figure 68).
Figure 68: Subconscious Jump

Crucially, this jump is not itself a conscious event?we cannotÿchooseÿwhat, when, or if anything appears in our conscious mind. We can only attempt to stimulate it by casting out metaphorical bait and waiting to see what emerges. Imagine, for instance, that you recall a person?s face but not their name. You may try focusing on the face or on something that person did. Eventually, the name may surface?or it may not. Either way, the outcome is not the result of conscious choice; it is a subconscious process.
Emotions, too, emerge from the subconscious?and we cannot choose which ones do or do not appear. We may predict that placing ourselves in certain situations will trigger particular emotions, but we do not control the emotional responses themselves. For example, you might decide to go on a road trip to feel happy and peaceful. Yet once you begin your journey, you unexpectedly feel nostalgia or sadness?emotions you neither predicted nor chose.
This highlights a key insight: while we may consciouslyÿpredictÿwhat the subconscious will do, we cannotÿcommandÿit. We might expect that certain situations will provoke certain thoughts or feelings?and we are often right?but we remain powerless to choose these outcomes directly. We may cast a line into the ocean of the subconscious, imagining which fish might bite, but we cannot decide which fish will jump out. In the end, we do not choose the emotions or preferences that guide our choices?we simplyÿacknowledgeÿthem when they rise to the surface.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
A Subconscious Hierarchy of Value
As discussed previously, our conscious evaluations are shaped by aÿhierarchy of values?a structured ordering of emotional responses based on their intensity. However, a similar hierarchy exists in theÿsubconscious. Strong emotional patterns stored beneath awareness can dominate our thoughts, preferences, and behaviours?sometimes in predictable ways, sometimes unpredictably.
Consider the following scenario: you are on a diet and know that there is a bakery around the corner. You have walked past it many times before and expect to do so again without incident. But this time, without warning, the smell or sight of your favourite pastry triggers a powerful emotional response?and you buy a doughnut, against your better judgement.
This example shows that even conscious decisions are influenced by thoughts and emotions arising from the subconscious. While we may be able toÿpredictÿthese intrusions, we cannotÿchooseÿtheir nature or intensity.
Summary: Chain Reaction
Bringing all this together, we may say that intentional behaviour results from aÿchain reaction, often initiated by an external stimulus interacting with the body. This interaction reaches the nervous system, where it eventually connects to the brain. There, past experiences and subconscious emotions?organised within their own emotional hierarchies?emerge into consciousness, joining the rest of our thoughts and feelings in a unified evaluative process. This process culminates in the choice of a specific behaviour (Figure 69).
Figure 69: Chain Reaction With Emotions

As we can now see, this model allows us to directly compare unintentional and intentional behaviours. In both, a chain of causes leads to a particular outcome. The essential difference lies in the presence?or absence?ofÿself-consciousness, and in particular,ÿemotionÿ(Figure 70).
Figure 70: Comparative Model of Behaviour


This raises a profound question. If our choices arise from a chain reaction, does this imply that we do not haveÿfree will? Does it mean that our lives unfold according to a fixed outcome orÿdestiny, irrespective of our choices? To explore these issues, let us now consider the concepts ofÿfree willÿandÿcontrol.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Free Will
There is a crucial difference between theÿabilityÿto choose and theÿfreedomÿto choose. We all have theÿabilityÿto acknowledge preferences and act accordingly. But the real question is whether we areÿfreeÿin doing so?or whether something else is choosing for us, beyond our control.
In this context, we defineÿfreedomÿasÿpower over limitation?the ability to be or do something despite any restriction. To determine whether we possess such freedom, we must first examine the factors thatÿlimitÿorÿinfluenceÿour choices.
Beyond Our Control
Control?and specificallyÿconsciousÿcontrol?implies a deliberate evaluative process. In this sense, we may refer toÿconsciousnessÿas theÿcontrol centreÿof the mind. All other processes?those of the body and the subconscious?lie outside of this control (Figure 71).
Figure 71: The Control Centre

In the paragraphs that follow, we explore several ways in which our choices may be madeÿfor usÿby forces beyond our control. While some of these influences can be mitigated or escaped, others may prove inescapable.
Imagine a shopkeeper being forced to hand over cash because someone is holding a knife to their back. We might reasonably say that the shopkeeper would have chosen differently if the knife were not present.
Consider also the effects ofÿdrugs,ÿpsychiatric conditions, orÿbrain tumours. These can alter our behaviour dramatically, affecting personality and decision-making. In such cases, the interaction between chemical agents and the brain is beyond the reach of conscious control (Figure 72). While external coercion?like a visible threat?can be recognised, internal influences may remain undetected. Drugs or diseases act directly on subconscious systems. Unless we begin to notice erratic or uncharacteristic behaviour, we may not even suspect that our thoughts are being altered.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 72: Drugs and Diseases

Now imagine a more extreme example: a scientist implants a transmitter in your brain, linking your mind to his computer. He monitors your conscious and subconscious thoughts on a screen?and manipulates them at will. You used to dislike pink shirts. One day, you try one on, like it, and buy it. You believe this change in taste is your own. But in truth, the scientist replaced your negative emotional response with a positive one. If someone later asks, ?Did you choose freely to buy the shirt?? you might say, ?Yes, I liked it.? Yet your preference was never truly yours (Figure 73). Subliminal messages, though more subtle, can have a similar effect?altering preferences without our awareness or consent.
Figure 73: The Mad Scientist

Physiological changes within the body may also influence choice. Hormonal shifts may make us feel angry or anxious in circumstances where we would prefer to remain calm. Beneath the skin, a vast network of processes?cellular, chemical, systemic?is constantly at work, outside the jurisdiction of the conscious mind. We do not choose when to feel hungry, experience pain, or suffer an irregular heartbeat.
Finally, let us consider the tiniest scale?theÿparticlesÿof consciousness. Suppose that our visual thoughts are composed of countless microscopic elements, like pixels on a screen. These might be thought of asÿsubconscious particles of thought. Even if we are aware of the full mental image?say, the idea of a pink shirt?we remain unaware of the countless spinning atoms and interactions that give rise to it. The identity, movement, and behaviour of these particles are entirely subconscious. When they change?even slightly?they can alter our thoughts and emotions, entirely beyond our control.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Our Will Is Never Completely Free
What would it take to make ourÿconsciousnessÿcompletely free? To begin with, we would need to remove every possible interfering agent?external influences like coercion, internal disruptions like drugs or disease, and even physical structures like brain implants.
But what about the ordinary functions and structures of the body?the hormones, neurons, and even the subatomic particles that shape how we think and feel? To be free from their influence, we would have to imagine that consciousness is made ofÿetherealÿthoughts and feelings?belonging to a dimension entirely distinct from that of the body. Yet even in this extreme scenario, where theÿmindÿis incorporeal and exists in a separate dimension, we still would not possess complete free will. That is because our consciousness would still be structured and activated by aÿchain reaction beyond our control. Whether nerves in the finger interact with physical brain particles, or with ethereal thoughts in another realm, the arrival of pain in our awareness still follows a causal sequence outside our choosing.
There is also a more fundamental reason why even an ethereal consciousness would remain bound. Quite simply, we cannot choose what populates theÿoriginÿof our mind. Even if it existed outside the body, we would have no say in what enters it first.
So when speaking of theÿfreedomÿof our will, we must ask: freedomÿfrom what? If there are no external agents coercing us, we may claim freedom fromÿthem. If we are healthy and sober, we may claim freedom fromÿdrugsÿorÿillness. But we cannot claim freedom from the body itself?constantly feeding our consciousness with emotions, memories, and direct experiences. More striking still, we were never free to decide what entered our empty mind at its inception.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
It JustÿFeelsÿFree!
Some may argue that even if the chain of causality is beyond our control, we must still possess free will?becauseÿit feels free. But how is this possible?
The answer lies in the nature of self-awareness. When we think or feel, we do so in theÿfirst person?not as spectators of a chain reaction, but as participants within it. Even if our brain is drugged, diseased, or manipulated by a scientist, we continue to experience ourselves asÿfreelyÿmaking choices.
Our mindÿfeelsÿfree because we cannot disagree with ourÿcurrentÿthoughts and feelings. We may disagree with past choices, but never with the choice we are makingÿright now. Why? Because weÿareÿour thoughts and feelings. In fact, we operate first at a basic Level 1 of the mind?subconscious experience?long before reaching the more reflective Level 4, self-consciousness, in which we begin to conceptualise that weÿhaveÿthoughts and feelings.
Ultimately, our will is not?and cannot be?completely free, because our consciousness is always shaped by a chain of events beyond its control. And yet, itÿfeelsÿfree because the forces that determine us are not external to us?theyÿareÿus. They define who we are and what we want.
Destiny
The notion ofÿfree willÿis intimately related to the idea ofÿdestiny. Free will concerns theÿcauseÿof our choices; destiny concerns theirÿoutcome. More specifically, destiny is anyÿunchangeableÿoutcome of a chain of events. We may think of destiny retrospectively?looking back from an outcome to its cause?or prospectively?anticipating a fixed future. Let us consider both.
Retrospective Destiny
Suppose you are playing pool. You strike the cue ball, and it pots three others. Looking back, we can assume that the way you hit the ball, the table?s angle, the room?s humidity, and countless other variablesÿdeterminedÿthe outcome. When observed in reverse?from outcome to origin?every past eventÿappears fixed and unchangeable.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Prospective Destiny
Now take the same scenario, but imagine thatÿbeforeÿmaking your shot, you announce to your friends, ?It is the destiny of these three balls to be potted all at once.? Your friends immediately challenge your claim. And rightly so.
The problem with predicting destinyÿbeforeÿit unfolds is not that causality ceases to operate, but that the chain isÿtoo complex. Countless factors could affect the outcome?unexpected noises, surface anomalies, momentary muscle twitches, or even microscopic irregularities in the table. Add to that the neurological signals in your brain, the molecular composition of the cue, the quantum behaviour of subatomic particles?and it becomes evident that no one can know the outcome with absolute certainty.
So when someone says, ?It is your destiny to become a lawyer,? what should you think ifÿyouÿwant to become a singer? Can that person account for your personality, environment, passions, relationships, and every variable that will shape your future? The claim of knowing another?s destiny ignores theÿenormous intricacyÿof how anything happens.
In summary: the presence of aÿchain reactionÿimplies that every outcomeÿhasÿa destiny. But that should never be confused with the idea that someone canÿpredictÿit.
Are We Free to Choose Our Destiny, or Not?
The fact that we cannot know our future with certainty leaves room forÿprobability. And within that space, ourÿchoices matter.
For example, when you aim to pot a ball, you increase the likelihood of success, even if you cannotÿguaranteeÿit. Similarly, when we make choices in life, we push the odds toward a desired outcome, even if we cannot be certain it will happen.
So, in one sense, we are bound by destiny. But in another, we areÿfreedÿby our ignorance of it.
Therefore, if someone tells you what your future holds, instead of replying, ?Destiny doesn?t exist because I choose my path,? you might say:ÿ?Destiny does exist?but since no one truly knows it, I am always free to choose toward a possible future, hoping to increase the probability that what I want will come to pass.?

A Theory of Everything
The next time you find yourself gazing at the night sky, wondering about the origin or fate of the universe?or reflecting on something tragic or beautiful that has happened to you?consider the following as a possibleÿtheory of everything: a unifying explanation for existence, for behaviour, and for how a tiny, fragile life like yours can find meaning against the infinite backdrop of eternity.
Figure 74: The Theory of Everything

The theory of everything (Figure 74) brings together theÿmodel of eternityÿ(e.g. Figure 9) and theÿmodel of behaviourÿ(Figure 70), placingÿus?sentient beings?at the centre of it all. It may be a simple image, but it captures something extraordinary: the idea that our self-consciousness, bursting withÿemotions,ÿbeauty,ÿempathy, andÿpurpose, stands in stark contrast to the barren silence of empty space, dead matter, and dimensionless infinity.
We are, in a sense, theÿbeating heartÿof the cosmos. The source of allÿmeaning?because there is no significance in the universe withoutÿsomeoneÿto say that it matters. A book is just paper and ink without a reader. The dance of the stars in the Milky Way is a lifeless pattern?until someone watches it in awe.
Remarkably, we arise from a world without feeling. Just asÿwaterÿemerges from dry hydrogen and oxygen, andÿlightÿfrom invisible particles,ÿmeaningÿemerges from meaningless atoms. The universe gave us bodies of stardust capable of emotion?and in turn, we give the universe itsÿmeaning. Eternity made us, and we give eternityÿvalueÿin return.
Figure 74 also illustrates theÿinterconnected chain of causalityÿunderlying all behaviour?intentional and unintentional. All change arises from the interplay of attractive and repulsive forces. What distinguishesÿintentional behaviourÿis the presence ofÿemotions, acting as those forces.
And when we contemplate the full reach of this chain?extending into the past or into the future?we must reckon with the possibility that it isÿinfinite, and therefore has no beginning or end. But if itÿisÿfinite, then we must anticipate aÿfirst causeÿand aÿfinal destiny. And we know from earlier chapters that the only reality that can exist beyond time and space is aÿstate of equality.
Why does this matter? Because when we ask, ?Why did this happen to me?? or ?What is the end of all things???the ultimate answer, at both extremes of existence, is the same: a dimensionless, unintelligent, infinite energy of zero complexity.

Beyond the Theory of Everything
Theÿtheory of everythingÿproposed here is not a cure-all. It is an intellectual framework?one that may serve as an antidote toÿnihilism. But it is not everything you need.
This theory tells us that anything can be a source of purpose?but it does not guarantee that we will always feel purpose. If life is starving for meaning, there is only so much a diagram can offer.
To feel trulyÿworthwhile, we often need more than philosophy. We needÿpeople. We may marvel at infinity, but our hearts beat faster when we share that marvel with someone. Meaning may be born in the stars?but it often comes to life in companionship.

Purpose and Religion
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

?And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.??Surah Al-Dhariyat 51:56 (Quran)
God and Purpose
A commonly held religious belief asserts that without God, life has noÿpurpose, and everything is ultimatelyÿmeaningless. But is this true?
Well, no?it is not. To better understand why, we must split the claim into two distinct propositions: (1) that there is no purpose without theÿexistenceÿof God, and (2) that there is no purpose withoutÿbeliefÿin God. The first implies that God gives purpose to everything, regardless of our belief. The second suggests that purpose is only granted to those who believe in Him.
Without the Existence of God
Let us refer back to the explanatory model presented in theÿtheory of everything, and examine how God fits into this framework?particularly in relation to the concept ofÿpurpose (Figure 75).
Figure 75: God and the ?Theory of Everything?

The figure reminds us of what was established in earlier chapters: thatÿGod cannot be the origin or end of existence, as He is tooÿcomplexÿto be aÿstate of equality. Restating this conclusion, we may also say that God cannot be theÿultimate reasonfor everything, nor theÿfinal destinyÿof it all. In this sense, God cannot be considered the ultimateÿpurposeÿor explanation of existence.
No Afterlife, No Purpose?
Another way God is often connected to our sense of purpose is through the belief that He offers the only pathway to anÿeternal afterlife. This leads many to wonder: ?If we all die, and there is no heaven, what is the point of life??
At present, science cannot grant us immortality. We have not yet overcome disease, ageing, or death. Yet it remains possible that, in the distant future, technological advances?such as subatomic manipulation of biological matter?might allow for the indefinite maintenance of youth and health.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Of course, to truly achieveÿeternal life, we would also need the universe itself to survive. Biological immortality would be of little value if the cosmos collapses into oblivion. Here, the greatest obstacle is the potential arrival of aÿstate of equality?the total equalisation of energy, which would annihilate all complexity and life. Still, one can imagine that a far-advanced civilisation might one day engineer a way to prevent such a state, keeping the universe ?alive? indefinitely.
In this view,ÿeternal physical lifeÿmay become a reality through progress?without invoking God.
But such future revolutions offer no comfort to us now. We, the people of this time, still face death. So again, we may ask:ÿwhat is the meaning of a life that ends?
Perhaps we can find insight by reversing the question:ÿwhat is the meaning of a life that never ends?ÿImmortality would surely be celebrated?at first. But beyond the relief of not ageing or suffering, what would sustain our sense ofÿworth? As with all privileges, we would eventually become accustomed to it?even immortality.
This shows that the need for meaning is not merely a need to escape death. Ourÿsense of purposeÿarises from the multitude of positive emotional responses triggered by the experiences and relationships in our lives?each capable of infusing existence with meaning, even in the face of mortality.
Would you rather live an immortal life in solitude or a mortal life in good company? This question illustrates that purpose is not ultimately aboutÿtime. Whether we live forever, for a thousand years, or just one more day, the presence of meaningful emotion remains key.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Without a Belief in God
People of faith may struggle to see it, but belief in God is neitherÿuniqueÿnorÿnecessaryÿfor purpose. Anything in life?not just God?can become meaningful, provided it elicits a positive emotional response.
Of course, for many, God is a profound emotional anchor and powerful source of purpose. But this is not true for all. Purpose can be found wherever emotional resonance occurs?whether in art, nature, family, science, or a quiet walk beneath the stars.
Now, consider a specific philosophical position in which belief in God isÿnotÿseen as belief in a creator, but as something else entirely. We have previously discussed that each person lives by aÿhierarchy of values, and that whatever sits at theÿtopÿof that hierarchy?be it God, wealth, health, freedom, love, or self-respect?becomes the most treasured and emotionally dominant thing in their life.
Some suggest that the powerful role of this highest value makes it worth labelling asÿdivine. In this model, ?God? becomes a placeholder for whatever tops an individual's value hierarchy. Yet while this idea may be intriguing, it is also deeply ambiguous?if not misleading. The wordÿGodÿtypically refers to a personal creator, with history, intention, and moral authority?not merely the most emotionally charged concept in one?s mind.
Religious Dissatisfaction
?Without God there can be no true happiness.? Many have heard this claim?or similar ones: ?Only in heaven, in the presence of God, will we be fully fulfilled.? Such beliefs often lead people to expect dissatisfaction in life. Their joy is projected into the afterlife, and their time on Earth is seen as incomplete or preparatory. They may also believe that if life?s experiences are not explicitly connected to God, then those experiences are somehow less meaningful. 
Where does this mindset come from? It seems to arise from a misunderstanding of infinity itself?often entangled with the notion of God?s infinite nature. The reasoning goes something like this: ?God is infinite, and I need God; therefore, I must need something infinite.? Thus, only an infinite being can fill the infinite ?hole? inside me.
But here is the problem: neither our thoughts nor emotions are infinite.ÿInfinityÿis only aÿconcept?not a quantity that can fill or fulfil us. Any thought of the infinite occupies a limited space and time in our consciousness, just like every other thought.
Furthermore, we have previously identified infinityÿas aÿdimensionless state of equality. But nobody trulyÿdesiresÿthat?because it would entail annihilation. If a person hoped to be absorbed into theÿonenessÿof God, and that oneness amounted to aÿstate of equality, there would be nothing left toÿfeel. Not even joy.
And so, the promise of eternal happiness through merging with an infinite God may, if taken literally, be a promise ofÿnothingness?not fulfilment.

God and Punishment
Certain religious scriptures speak ofÿoriginal sin?a first moral failure for which God punished humanity and continues to hold us accountable. However, as we will now explore, this belief is incompatible with our understanding ofÿintentional behaviour,ÿfree will, andÿdestiny.
Eve Has No Free Will
The story of original sin centres on the first woman, Eve. She eats the forbidden fruit, having been manipulated by the devil, and is punished by God for her disobedience. But there is a fundamental problem with such retribution:ÿEve?s will is not completely free, and therefore, she should not be held ultimately responsible for her action. To understand why, we must reflect on the nature ofÿintentional behaviour.
Figure 76: Eve?s Choice

Figure 76 symbolically represents Eve?s mind and body just before she eats the apple. We can safely assume that her choice was based on a total emotionalÿattractionÿto the prospect of eating the fruit?an attraction shaped by a complex interplay of internal factors. While we cannot know her exact thoughts, we can imagine her inner evaluation consisting of a mixture ofÿlikesÿ(pros) andÿdislikesÿ(cons), such as:
? Curiosity about something God had uniquely forbidden
? A desire to uncover God?s true intentions
? A reluctance to follow a rule she did not understand
? A yearning for greater knowledge
? Boredom or dissatisfaction with her current life
? A need to please God
? Respect for the rules
? Fear of punishment
? Trust in God
? A dislike of apples
Regardless of the specific content, theÿmechanismÿis the same. Every element in Eve?s evaluation?the curiosity, trust, fear, desire?emerged from her subconscious, beyond her control. She did notÿchooseÿhow intensely she feared God, nor how strongly she disliked the apple. These emotional elements surfaced involuntarily and shaped her final decision.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

But the subconscious was not the only influencing factor. Her broaderÿbiological contextÿcould have played a role: Was she tired? Anxious? Hungry? Did her genetic temperament make her more agreeable?or more defiant? Even her psychological disposition?empathetic or narcissistic?would have been determined by variables outside her control.
You might say, ?But Eveÿcouldÿhave resisted temptation?if she had more fear, more courage, or more self-restraint.? But the point remains:ÿshe didn?t. And that was not a free decision?it wasÿpredeterminedÿby a chain of physical, emotional, and subconscious factors.
In conclusion, Eve?s act of disobedience was not freely chosen in the ultimate sense. Her evaluation was shaped entirely by factors beyond her control. For this reason, God?s punishment of Eve cannot be justified within any coherent model ofÿintentional behaviour. And even if one were to accept some disciplinary necessity, it remains true thatÿa punitive response was not essential. A God of infinite wisdom could have opted forÿnon-punitive intervention, choosing to educate or guide her instead.
Legal Responsibility
At this point, one may worry that denying free will could undermine the foundations of society. If no one isÿultimately responsible for their actions, then how can we hold anyone accountable?particularly those who commit heinous crimes?
The answer lies in recognising that legal responsibility is anÿartificial construct?a social necessity based on aÿstrategic simplification. For law to function, we mustÿignoreÿthe deeper complexities of subconscious causes and physiological conditions. We isolate the moment ofÿchoice?when the brain ?secretes? a decision?and treat it as an autonomous act.
Most legal systems do not accept emotional states or ignorance as justification for wrongdoing. Why? Because every decision can, in theory, be traced to some subconscious or involuntary state. If we allowed these factors to excuse behaviour, the system would collapse.
That said, the law does occasionally account forÿdegreesÿof subconscious influence?such as the difference between a crime of passion and a premeditated offence. A spontaneous act following a sudden provocation may result in a lesser sentence than a calculated, deliberate attack. Here, the law reflects a nuanced understanding of the role emotions play in our actions?though it still treats the final behaviour asÿlegally accountable.
In summary, legal systems function by enforcingÿnormative expectations?standards of behaviour that deliberately ignore the absence of completely free will. In this sense,ÿlegal responsibility is real, butÿphilosophically artificial.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Conditional Love
It is often said that God has left us ?free? to accept or reject Him?that we are allowed to make our own choice. But this is not true. There is no meaningfulÿfreedom from God if judgement awaits those who make the ?wrong? choice. This is like claiming we are free to steal an apple?so long as we accept that we will be arrested. Yet, in this case, we areÿallÿgoing to be arrested?after death, before the divine Judge. That is not freedom.
This brings us to a further issue: the claim thatÿGod?s love is unconditional. Again, this does not hold up. Imagine a parent saying, ?When you turn thirty, I will judge you. If you did not do what I expected, I will abandon you?forever.? No one would call that unconditional love. We would not accept it from a mother. Why then should we accept it from God?
True unconditional love cannot include the threat ofÿeternal punishment. And yet, in many belief systems, that is exactly what is promised to those who fail to meet divine expectations. If hell is on the table,ÿGod?s love is conditional?not infinite, and not unreserved.

Peace
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

?If you want to make peace, you don?t talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.??Desmond Tutu

Peace
Having explored the foundations of existence and purpose, we now turn to the pursuit and sharing of truth?the only road to lasting peace, as it draws us together around a common reality. Falsehoods, by contrast, lead only to short cul-de-sacs, isolating individuals and splintering society into fragmented, disconnected groups.
It is often easier to know how to act duringÿwartime. A clear enemy unites us. Our sense of community intensifies under the shared goal ofÿdefeating the invaderÿandÿprotecting our own. But once the external enemy has been vanquished and our collective purpose dissolves, we often begin to fracture. Slowly, yet relentlessly, we divide?falling victim to more insidiousÿinternal struggles. A nation free from foreign attacks is not yet free from the countless social conflicts within. These can become strong enough to end a civilisation?and they are often harder to detect than a tank firing at you.
So how can we preserve peaceÿpermanently, without wandering aimlessly toward decline or self-destruction? To do so, we must first understand the nature ofÿpeaceÿitself, identify the roots ofÿconflict, and explore theÿtoolsÿwe have to address them. More importantly, we must confront the dangerousÿideologiesÿthat disable these tools?like viruses attacking the immune system?leaving us resourceless and defenceless in the face of escalating division.
What Is Peace?
Whenever weÿdislikeÿsomething, we may seek toÿchangeÿit. If we detest a broken chair, we may repair or replace it. If we hate disease, we may become a doctor to fight it. If we fear the threat of an asteroid, we may study astrophysics to protect the planet.
But what do we do when we dislike theÿbehaviourÿof another person? We cannot repair or replace them. Here lies the root ofÿconflict: the presence of at least two individuals whoÿprefer opposite behaviours. That is, one person prefers a certain action to occur, while another prefers itÿnotÿto occur.
More precisely, we can defineÿconflictÿas the presence of at least two individuals who either share theÿsame emotional responseÿtoÿopposite behavioursÿ(Figure 77-A), or haveÿopposite emotional responsesÿto theÿsame behaviourÿ(Figure 77-B). Simply put, conflict arises fromÿopposing behavioural preferences.
By contrast,ÿpeaceÿis the presence ofÿshared behavioural preferences?or the absence of conflict altogether.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Figure 77: Conflict

Under this definition, a community is peaceful whenÿno one dislikes anyone else?s behaviour. In such a society, nobody wishes to alter what others are doing, because everyone already behaves as everyone else wishes they would.
Conflict, on the other hand, exists if evenÿoneÿperson dislikesÿsomeone else?sÿactions. In the worst-case scenario,ÿeveryone dislikesÿeveryone else?sÿbehaviour?a condition of total discord.
From Conflict to Peace
How do we move from a state ofÿconflictÿto one ofÿpeace? Imagine a scenario in which someone is pointing a gun at your head, intending to kill you. You want to stay alive. In order to do so, you must change their behaviour. But how?
There are two principal options available: enforcement or persuasion (Figure 78).
Enforcementÿrefers to the act of altering someone?s behaviour without changing their underlying preference. For example, you might disarm the attacker or lock them in a room. They may still want to kill you, but they are no longer able to act on that desire.
Persuasion, by contrast, aims to change not only the behaviour but also the preference or intention behind it. This can happen in one of two ways, which we may callÿshallowÿandÿdeepÿpersuasion.
Shallow persuasion occurs when someone refrains from performing a conflicting action, not because their desire has disappeared, but because another emotional response temporarily takes precedence. For instance, if you offer the attacker a large sum of money to spare your life, or threaten them with revenge from your family, they may choose not to act. Yet, in this case, the desire to harm you remains?merely suppressed by a stronger emotional incentive or deterrent.
Deep persuasion, on the other hand, occurs when the desire itself is removed. If you are able to show the attacker convincing evidence that you were not involved in the wrongdoing they suspected, and they come to believe it, then their motivation to harm you vanishes. In this case, the conflict is resolved at its root?because the opposing preference no longer exists.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Figure 78: Conflict Resolution

Changing Many People?s Behaviour
These methods?enforcement and persuasion?can be applied toÿsocietalÿconflict as well. If all conflicts were resolved byÿenforcement, society would soon fill with prisons, chains, and execution sites. Ironically, the only peaceful society that results from enforcement alone is one in which all dissenters have beenÿkilled. This isÿpeace by extermination. Keeping peopleÿaliveÿthrough imprisonment, exile, or forced silence is not true peace?because the desire to rebel still exists. These people are latent sources of future conflict, waiting for the opportunity to resist. If, instead, every conflict were resolved throughÿshallow persuasion, people wouldÿappearÿto cooperate?but would retain theirÿunderlying disagreements. Many may choose a strategy of passive tolerance?a ?live and let live? mindset?to avoid open confrontation. While preferable to violence, this strategy breeds physical and emotionalÿdistancing. And when that distance is no longer sustainable, the underlying disagreements may erupt once again.
Onlyÿdeep persuasionÿoffers a stable path to peace. When all conflicting preferences are resolved by eliminating?not overpowering?the underlying desires, people begin toÿgenuinelyÿshare behavioural preferences. This is theÿdefinitionÿof peace. The more frequentlyÿdeep persuasionÿoccurs in society, the less enforcement and shallow persuasion are needed. We can visualise this progression with the image of a clock (Figure 79), where each moment of deep persuasion turns the hand forward, expanding the territory of shared understanding. Over time, enforcement and shallow persuasion fade away, until a full rotation is complete and peace is achieved.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Figure 79: The Clock of Peace

Speech
Deep persuasionÿis the only method by which conflict can be entirely removed without resorting to extermination. Therefore, if we are serious about reaching and maintainingÿpeace, we must ensure that theÿopportunity for persuasion?and thus, forÿcommunication?is maximised in society. This brings us to a critical insight: persuasion is only possible throughÿspeech, and speech requires two fundamental properties?freedomÿandÿopenness.
Free speechÿrefers to the ability to communicate our preferences to others with the aim of changing their behaviour. Without such freedom, persuasion becomes impossible. If one cannot speak, one cannot exchange ideas?and if ideas cannot be exchanged, they cannot be transformed.
Importantly, defendingÿfree speechÿmeans protecting the expression of opinions that others mayÿdislikeÿor findÿoffensive?not merely those that are already accepted. In fact, the most principled form of free speech is allowing people we detest to say things we detest. This may sound counterintuitive, but it is essential to the peace process. That said, speech must still serve its role as a substitute forÿforce. It ceases to function as a peace-making tool when used to incite violence or physical enforcement.
However, freedom of speech alone is not enough. Openness?or open-mindedness?is equally vital. This is the willingness to consider new ideas. Its opposite isÿclose-mindedness, often rooted in prejudice against the source of information. For example, a person might assume a child cannot understand complex mathematics. So, if a child writes down a correct solution to a difficult equation, the close-minded adult may reject it without even examining the work. In summary, bothÿfree speechÿandÿopen speechÿare required for persuasion?and, by extension, for peace.

The Law
Even if you were the most gifted communicator, persuading everyone to accept yourÿmoral preferencesÿwould still be an enormous challenge. And even if you were the strongest individual, forcing everyone to behave as you wish would be just as difficult.
Throughout history, communities have faced this same dilemma. They have discovered that one way to manage ongoingÿconflictÿis to establish aÿwritten listÿof behaviours that are either permitted or prohibited?along with a group of people tasked with enforcing these rules. This system forms the basis ofÿthe law, and its enforcers constitute theÿlaw enforcement bodyÿor agency.
Thus, the law can be defined as anyÿrule enforced by a dedicated group, specifying the expected behaviour for given circumstances. These rules may be specific (e.g. ?Turn right!?) or general (e.g. ?You must never lie!?).
The Properties of the Law
A functional legal system operates first and foremost as a mechanism forÿorganised enforcement, resulting in consequences such as arrest, fines, or imprisonment. But the law also acts as a form ofÿshallow persuasion. For example, a person might think, ?I enjoy stealing, but I don?t want to go to prison?so I won?t do it.? In this case, the desire to steal remains, but it is overridden by a stronger emotional response?fear of punishment.
This differs fromÿdeep persuasion, where the internal preference has changed altogether. Such a person might think, ?I don?t like stealing, and I wouldn?t do it even if it were legal.?
Beyond enforcement and deterrence, the law can also contribute indirectly toÿdeep persuasion?particularly through education. For example, mandatory schooling may help individuals understand the moral reasoning behind certain rules, making them more likely to internalise those values and behave accordingly, even without the threat of punishment.
Taken together, the law plays a powerful and practical role in reducing conflict. But while it is essentialÿin practice, it isÿnot essential in principle. Ideally, a peaceful society would not require enforcement, deterrents, or rewards. People would behave in a way that nobody disliked, simply because theyÿshared preferences. This hypothetical state?corresponding to a full revolution of the peace clock?is when the law becomesÿobsolete.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Making the Law
So how do we transition from a lawless society to one governed by an effective legal system?
There are two basic steps (Figure 80). First, we must identify our own preferences and determine which behaviours we would like toÿallowÿorÿprohibit. Second, we must eitherÿenforceÿthose preferences upon others orÿpersuadeÿthem to accept them as shared values, eventually codified into law.
Figure 80: Making the Law

As with any other decision, ourÿbehavioural preferencesÿare shaped by the full structure of ourÿevaluation process, itself determined by our individualÿhierarchy of values?such as life, freedom, family, peace, health, or wealth.
Once these preferences have been identified, we may choose the path ofÿenforcement, imposing them on others through physical dominance or with the help of a private law enforcement body. This might involve a personal army or security force that follows our commands. However, even this scenario requires an initial act ofÿpersuasion?to convince the soldiers to obey.
Alternatively, we may choose the path ofÿpersuasionÿfrom the outset, seeking to convince others that our preferences should be shared and ultimately codified into law. Suppose, for example, that ten people are trying to agree on a set of behavioural rules. Initially, they all disagree. To move fromÿdisagreementÿtoÿagreement, each must engage with theÿvalue hierarchiesÿof the others. They must ask questions such as: Is life more important than family? Is health more valuable than wealth? Does freedom outweigh convenience? Is justice more precious than power?
In practice, this process requires each person to adjust the structure of others? evaluations?adding or removing, strengthening or softening?until aÿshared preferenceÿemerges. In short, making law through persuasion is ultimately aboutÿsharing values first, and rules second. Such a painstaking process is only possible in the presence ofÿfree and open speech.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Emotion and the Law
Because ourÿmoral preferencesÿare rooted in emotional responses, it follows that the law?being built upon such preferences?is also vulnerable to theÿfluctuations of emotion. Emotions change in type and intensity, and so may our views on what should be legal or illegal.
Imagine someone who considers the death penalty immoral and campaigns for its abolition. After years of protest, the government changes the law. But the day after the reform, that person?s child is abducted and harmed by a serial offender. The perpetrator confesses to similar crimes against other children. Overcome by grief and rage, the same person who once fought to ban capital punishment now begins to demand its reinstatement.
This scenario reveals the danger of placing law in the hands of a single person, whose emotional state may change quickly and radically. If one day he feels fear or hatred toward a certain group, he might suddenly write a law to punish them. To prevent this, most legal systems require thatÿseveral people?each with different emotional contexts?agree before laws can be changed. This is one of the key strengths ofÿdemocracy: that laws are revised only afterÿcollective deliberation. The moreÿfundamentalÿthe law, the more agreement is needed to amend it?as seen in constitutional law.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Enforcing the Law
Whileÿmakingÿthe law requires debate, empathy, and the exchange of moral opinions,ÿenforcingÿthe law is a more technical act?and does not require emotional involvement.
Law enforcement officers are not tasked with agreeing or disagreeing with the law; they simply compare observed behaviour to what is written in the legal code. Even if they personally oppose a specific rule, they can still recognise whether an action violates it. In this way, the written lawÿtranslates subjective moral preferences into objective behavioural standards.
When someone says, ?It is wrong to kill,? they may be expressing either aÿpersonal moral judgementÿor aÿlegal standard. If no law exists yet, and people are debating whether killing is wrong, a more accurate expression would be: ?Killingÿfeels wrong??since this refers to theirÿempathic response, not an established rule. Nonetheless, moral statements are often expressed in absolute terms to give weight to the speaker?s opinion, implying that theyÿoughtÿto be encoded in law.
Social Equality
The concept of social equality?not to be confused with the ontological equality of zero complexity discussed in earlier chapters?is fundamental to both the formulation and application of law, and by extension, to the pursuit of peace. To understand this, we must examine two central principles, which we can call theÿsocial equality laws.
Social or group equality means thatÿdifferent individuals belong to the same group. However, this doesÿnotÿimply that all individuals are the same. It simply means that we identify aÿshared featureÿby which people are grouped together.
?All Are Equal Under the Law?
The first principle states:ÿAll are equal under the lawÿ(Figure 81). Here, ?under? signifies being aÿsubjectÿof the law. This means that all members of a society, regardless of their beliefs, identity, or affiliations, are bound by the law in the same way.

Figure 81: The Social Equality Laws


But for this principle to function properly, we must ask:ÿWhoÿcounts as ?all?? The law can group people according to any shared characteristic?gender, ethnicity, income, intelligence, and so on. But every feature we choose has the power toÿdivide, not unite. If we say, ?All white people are equal under the law,? we are excluding non-white individuals. If we say, ?All the poor,? we exclude the rich.
To reach genuineÿgroup equality, we must define ?all? in a way that includesÿeveryone. So, what is the one feature that all people, regardless of background, possess? To find the answer, we must look at what makes someone aÿperson.
The Identity of a Person
Imagine a man born without arms or legs. Is he still a person? Suppose that after an accident, he loses his body below the neck but survives through advanced technology. Is he still a person? Now imagine his brain is placed into a robotic head, retaining the ability to think, feel, and speak. Is he still a person?
What if he later enters a dreamlike state in which he no longer speaks, but his artificial face reflects emotions? Is he still a person? And finally, suppose those dreams and emotions disappear altogether.ÿIs he still a person?
If we say that personhood ends only when emotions cease?conscious or unconscious?then we are saying thatÿemotion is the essential criterion for personhood.
And indeed, it is. Regardless of physical form, culture, belief, or behaviour,ÿall people are emotional beings. In this sense, we belong to theÿsame group?and are therefore entitled to theÿsame rights. We may also includeÿconsciousnessÿor theÿpotential for consciousnessÿas another essential trait. But as we will see next, emotion is not just a marker of personhood?it is also theÿfoundation of human value.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
The Essential Value of Humanity
Emotion is the source ofÿempathy, and empathy is what causes us toÿcare. This is what gives peopleÿinherent value?not their appearance, status, culture, or beliefs, but the fact that theyÿcan suffer and feel.
Imagine a drowning man. You recognise him as a criminal with no friends or family. Saving him would earn you no reward. And yet, you save him?not because of who he is, but because ofÿwhatÿhe is: a fellow emotional being. Without our empathic response, we would not care about others?nor value their lives.
Animals and Aliens
Many animals are capable of emotion, and our value for them also arises fromÿempathy. But our empathic response tends to be weaker toward non-human creatures, forming a kind ofÿvalue hierarchy. A dog, a cat, or an insect may all evoke emotion?but usually less than that evoked by a person. And so, if someone feels stronger empathy for a drowning dog than for a drowning child, they may rescue the dog first. That choice is shaped byÿthe intensity of their emotional response.
Now imagine an alien civilisation that has conquered Earth. How might we persuade them not to annihilate us? If we cannot fight them, and have nothing material to offer, our final strategy might be toÿelicit their empathy?to make them see us asÿemotionally valuable. The same logic would apply if we were the conquerors. Our willingness to spare or protect another species would likely depend on whether we feel anÿempathic connection.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
?All Are Equal Above the Law?
The second principle of social equality is:ÿAll are equal above the lawÿ(Figure 81). Here, ?above? means being aÿmakerÿof the law. Regardless of status, belief, or background, everyone should have the sameÿopportunity to influence the law through persuasion.
This principle is vital because it empowersÿall members of societyÿto engage in legal transformation. In a functioning democracy, every citizen is bothÿsubject toÿandÿshaper ofÿthe law. They are not just governed?they are participants in governance.
Democracy
Aÿdemocraticÿsociety is one that upholds both principles of social equality. All citizens areÿequal under the law, and all have the same opportunity toÿshape it. In such a society, inner conflicts can be managed throughÿdebate, not violence, because people are equipped with both aÿvoiceÿand aÿplatform.
As we will see in the next chapter, these two principles of social equality stand in direct opposition to political or philosophical systems that obstruct peace?particularly tyranny, relativism, and absolutism. The presence of these two laws in a legal system can be seen as a marker of immunity against such ideologies. They foster a world in which every person is valued not for their differences, but for their shared emotional humanity.

?Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.??Matthew 10:37 (New Testament).

In this chapter, we will examineÿtyranny,ÿrelativism, andÿabsolutism?particularlyÿreligious absolutism?and show how each of these ideological frameworks fails to promote or guarantee a peaceful society. We will argue that they adopt anÿauthority-based, rather thanÿopportunity-basedÿapproach to lawmaking; that they undermineÿtrue social equality; that they tolerateÿclosed speech; and, most destructively, that they obstruct the democratic journey towards peace by degrading legislative function and encouraging cultural segregation. In the end, they foster societies composed ofÿfragmented, caged communities, incapable of true integration.
Tyranny, Relativism, and Absolutism
Imagine a small community gathered at a round table, where members are taking turns sharing their moral preferences. Suddenly, one person stands up and declares: ?I am more powerful than all of you. Who are you to tell me what is right and wrong?? He then imposes his will through force. This is aÿtyrant, and the legal system he imposes is aÿtyranny.
Eventually, the tyrant dies. The community, united in its rejection of tyranny, writes its first law:ÿAll are equal under the law. With this, people return to sharing their preferences. But now, someone else stands and says: ?Since we are all equal, who are you to tell me what is right and wrong?? Everyone agrees. As a result, no one attempts to persuade anyone else about moral matters, and no further rules are created. This isÿrelativism. The society remains permanently unlegislated?except for that single law of equality.
After some time, a new voice rises: ?We all agree that we are equal?but I have discovered a set of laws that do not come from me, but from aÿsuperior source.? Suppose everyone believes this. From that moment on, the community lives under a legal code that cannot be challenged or changed, because its author is presumed to beÿuntouchable. This isÿabsolutism. If you agree with the rules, you are fortunate. If you don?t, you are trapped with them forever.
The key question becomes:ÿHow can we escape absolutism without regressing into relativism?ÿTo answer this, we must understand the specific failures of each ideology in relation to three principles essential for peace:ÿsocial equality,ÿopenness and freedom of speech, andÿlegislative reformability.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

What?s Wrong with Tyranny?
Tyranny arises whenÿmoral superiorityÿis imposed by force, bypassing both free speechÿandÿsocial equality. A tyrant places himselfÿaboveÿeveryone else andÿoutsideÿthe law (Figure 82). He is not subject to it, nor can others change it.
Now, a tyrant might not be immoral. He could be a wise and well-meaning ruler. But history shows that benevolent tyrants are rare?and the risk is simply too high. A single person?s whims?no matter how virtuous?are insufficient protection against the erosion of freedom. Tyranny is too unstable and too dangerous to serve as a reliable foundation for peace.
Note: The specific issues surrounding speech, equality, and legislation in tyranny overlap with those in absolutism, and will be examined more closely in that context.
Figure 82: Tyranny, Relativism and Absolutism

What?s Wrong with Relativism?
Relativism may initially seem to promote equality and peace, but in reality, it paralyses the legal process. By denying individuals the right to persuade one another, it suppresses moral debate and stalls the development of law. A relativist society might uphold the first essential principle?that all are equal under the law?but it never attains the second: that all are equal above the law (Figure 82). In such a system, no one can legislate, and therefore, no one can progress.
This ideology is built on two mistaken assumptions: first, that social equality necessitates equality of output; and second, that persuasion depends on authority. Let us examine each in turn.
First Flawed Assumption: Equality of Output
Relativism confusesÿsocial equalityÿwith the idea that all people?sÿoutputs?their actions, beliefs, or expressions?are of equal value. But this is false. Imagine ten bakers enter a lemon cake competition. Each presents their cake to a panel of judges. Even though the bakers are socially equal?members of the same community?it does not follow that all the cakes are equally good. One cake may be better in taste, texture, or appearance. The bakers are equal; their cakes are not.
This applies to all human expression. Opinions, ideas, books, paintings, songs, arguments?these are allÿoutputs. And outputs can vary inÿquality, just as cakes do. Social equality does not mean that all moral claims or artistic works are equally valid. It simply means that everyoneÿdeserves a chanceÿto speak and be heard.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Second Flawed Assumption: No Authority Means No Opportunity
Relativism assumes thatÿwithout authority, persuasion is impossible. But this too is mistaken. Let us return to the cake competition. The judges may evaluate each cake based purely on its merit?its flavour and design. Or they may be swayed byÿauthority?for example, if one cake is baked using a recipe from a famous chef or holy book. Authorityÿcanÿinfluence judgement, but it is notÿrequiredÿfor persuasion.
The same is true of moral debate. A person may persuade others not because of who they are, but because their argument isÿcompelling. To ask, ?Who are you to tell me what is right and wrong?? is like asking, ?Who are you to bake the best cake?? The answer: ?No one special. But if what I say is better, it might persuade you?unless you refuse to listen.?
Ironically, relativism silences moral debate in the name of equality?thereby suppressingÿopportunity. While non-relativists remain open to dialogue, relativists close their minds in advance, requiringÿauthorityÿwhere onlyÿreasonÿis needed.
The Democratic Vote
Democracy resolves the tension between authority and opportunity by ensuring thatÿno one has the power to impose, yetÿeveryone has the right to persuade. Within a democracy,ÿspeech replaces force.
However, we must distinguish between two aspects of democracy:ÿdebateÿandÿvoting. Debate allows moral preferences to be compared, challenged, and refined. Voting resolves a stalemate.
Imagine you are a politician who believes slavery is wrong, but others in parliament disagree. You debate passionately. If you persuade others, the law changes. But if debate fails, the matter goes to a vote. In that moment, yourÿoutput?your moral position?is artificially levelled with every other vote. This is not because your position is equal in truth or value, but because the system must move forward. The vote is aÿtemporary compromise, not a declaration of relativistic equality.
A democratic vote does not mean all opinions are equally correct. It means:ÿIf we cannot persuade each other, we must still act?peacefully. A vote is the tool that prevents disagreement from escalating into violence. It preserves the survival of a functioning parliament, legal system, and enforcement body.
And crucially, democracy does not silence those whose views are rejected. After the vote, persuasion may continue. The moral argument may evolve. What is lost at the ballot may yet be won in the future?through speech, not force.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
What?s Wrong with Absolutism?
Absolutism is a significant obstacle to the peace process because it renders law immutable?nobody has the power to change it, no matter how necessary the change may be. This makes it clearly incompatible with theÿsecond social equality lawÿ(Figure 82), which states that all individuals must have the same opportunity to participate in the creation or reform of law. Absolutism is, in essence, a form ofÿtyranny by proxy, where a so-called ?superior source? functions as a remote tyrant, acting through its followers. And in many ways, it can be even more restrictive than tyranny itself. While a tyrant may, at least in theory, be confronted or persuaded directly, the author of an absolutist law is absent, inaccessible, or altogether non-existent?leaving no possible avenue for appeal, revision, or reform.
Equal Inferiority
Absolutism often emerges as a reaction to relativistic lawlessness, presenting itself as a saviour ideology that offers moral order. Yet relativism and absolutism are not ideological opposites?they are more likeÿtwo faces of the same coin. For example, absolutists may fully adopt the relativistic belief that since everyone is equal, no individual has the authority to tell others what is right or wrong. Yet, they still uphold the supreme authority of a selected source whose rules are exempt from challenge. This contradiction results in what we might callÿrelativistic absolutism?a philosophical Frankenstein in which all humans are consideredÿequally inferiorÿto a single superior authority.
Such a worldview enshrines what we may termÿequality by inferiority: the belief that no moral opinion, not even the most persuasive or well-reasoned, can ever equal or surpass the decrees of a designated superior source. But where does this belief come from? How do people come to view a set of rules as untouchably superior to all human judgment?
For most absolutists, the answer lies in the perceived origin of the law: it is eitherÿobjectiveÿorÿinfallible. As we are about to explore, both claims collapse under scrutiny.
The Objective Source
For the absolutist, moral authority is vested in a written set of instructions?often divine commandments?which are considered fixed, reliable, and superior to the volatile, subjective moral preferences of individuals. But this reasoning is flawed.
As previously argued, all moral judgment is inherentlyÿsubjective, shaped by empathic and aesthetic responses that emerge from emotion. Morality, like preference, cannot escape this foundation.
The confusion likely stems from howÿwritten lawsÿareÿused. Written instructions function as objective tools for enforcement: they are visible, readable, and repeatable, requiring no emotional investment or moral agreement from those who apply them. This applies equally to a religious commandment or a sign at a swimming pool. Both "Do not kill" and "No diving" are objective in form?they are simply printed rules. But objectivity in form does not imply moral authority.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
What gives a sign legal weight is not its clarity or permanence?it isÿconsent. If you find a "No diving" sign in a rubbish bin, it is not law. But if the community agrees with its instruction and persuades the local council to display it by the pool, then it becomes enforceable. The same applies to any written rule: for it to become law, it must beÿadoptedÿthrough a subjective process of moral evaluation and communal agreement.
Thus, to adopt a set of divine commandments as law is, in the end, aÿchoice?a preference based on emotion and interpretation. There is no escaping the subjectivity at the heart of the process.
The Infallible Source
As discussed earlier inÿCertainty and Religion, infallibility is an unprovable belief. To declare a law infallible is to assume its author is omniscient. But omniscience is impossible to prove?and therefore, so is infallibility. Even if a lawÿappears perfect, it remains subject to reinterpretation, contradiction, and new evidence.
In truth, the claim that something is infallible ultimately relies onÿimperfect human judgment. It is people who declare that a law cannot be wrong?using the very fallibility they seek to escape. And therein lies the paradox: every belief in infallibility rests on a foundation that is, by its own admission, fallible.
Democracy: An Ideology of Peace
Tyranny, relativism, and absolutism all share one crucial flaw: they each treatÿauthorityÿas a necessary condition for law. But law does not require authority?it requiresÿopportunity. In a democracy, individuals need no special status or divine mandate to contribute to the legislative process. They simply need the opportunity to express, compare, and defend their values through persuasion. The democratic ideal is not thatÿall ideas are equal, but thatÿall individuals have the right to try to persuade others of their ideas. In this way, a democracy becomes anÿopportunity-drivenÿsociety, in contrast to theÿauthority-drivenÿmodels of tyranny and absolutism.
As such, democracy is the only system fundamentally equipped to resolve conflict through peaceful means. It is a process underpinned byÿfree and open speech, andÿtrue social equality?defined not by conformity, but by shared human dignity and mutual access to the tools of persuasion.

Discrimination
Social equality is not only crucial to lawmaking; it also shapes how people judge and treat one another in everyday life. Indeed, an authority-based ideology does not merely distort the legal system?it also corrupts human relationships.
In this text,ÿdiscriminationÿis defined as the act of judging someone as inadequate or unworthy based on aÿpartial or incomplete evaluation. This usually involves reducing a person to a single feature?such as their race, gender, class, or religion?and ignoring the rest.
Intolerance is a form of discrimination, expressed across a broad spectrum. Figure 83 illustrates different levels of intolerance, categorised asÿpublicÿorÿprivate, and arranged according to how much freedom the victim retains. At the extreme end of the spectrum, people may be killed, imprisoned, or otherwise silenced for who they are.
Figure 83: Spectrum of Discrimination

A society can enact laws to restrict or punishÿpublicÿforms of discrimination?by banning racial segregation, protecting workplace rights, or enforcing equal access to services. However,ÿprivate intoleranceÿis harder to reach. Laws cannot force individuals to form friendships, fall in love, or marry someone they are prejudiced against. This is what we callÿthe legal wall of private intolerance.
Behind this wall, the only effective tool for change is speech. We must raise awareness, expose ideological roots, and persuade minds. Yet even persuasion becomes difficult in the face of one of the most insidious forms of discrimination?found at the opposite end of the spectrum: the belief that someone is not good enough to be right.
This is the core ofÿclosed-mindedness: to reject a person?s claimÿnot because of its merit, but because of who is making it. The speaker is dismissed?not due to the strength of their argument, but because they are assumed to be inherently unworthy of offering one.
And this, more than any one law, is what divides a society. It is not merely disagreement?it isÿrefusal. A refusal to hear, to understand, or to believe that value can come from anyone, regardless of status or affiliation. In the end, peace is not won through agreement alone?but through theÿwillingness to listen.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Religious Discrimination
Religious discrimination is the kind of bias exhibited by people of faith as a direct consequence of their beliefs against members of other religions, or non-believers. But where does it come from? Is it sanctioned by the doctrine itself, or is it in fact a problem of corrupt individuals who are deviating from it? If you asked people of faith they would, most likely, point out that their belief system does not promote division but love and inclusivity, as we are all ?Children of God.? Moreover, some would add that the pillar of their faith is in fact ?love,? of which God is the utmost expression, and his prophets the best representatives.
Unfortunately, beyond these words, and often a truly innocent and genuine mindset, the actual theological foundation of religion can be one of discrimination, due to an essentially absolutist core. But let?s have a look at this more closely.
The Religious Wall of Private Intolerance
Imagine a world made by a single landmass in the middle of the ocean. Here live only two religious communities, which, for many years, have fought to impose their creeds onto each other. Their differences often caused violent conflicts, characterised by beatings, killings, imprisonment, and slavery. We could refer to this period of unrest as the ?jungle? state (Figure 84). 
Figure 84: From Complete Intolerance to Complete Peace

Eventually, the two communities agreed to build a giant wall (Figure 84) stretching from coast to coast, to avoid more wars and violent deaths. So, now the world is at peace within each community, where everyone is faithfully and happily abiding to their scriptures. At this stage, religions have stopped fighting or trying to convince one another of their moral divine supremacy, and live joyfully, confined to their side of the world. Each would look at themselves with a sense of accomplishment, believing that they are living at the best of their potential, where true love and peace was made possible by abiding strictly to the divine commandments. 
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Some would claim that this is an acceptable endpoint for society, as bringing the wall down would only facilitate conflict at the borders, easily spreading across the land. In fact, this is what happens in the real world, where, despite legally enforced public tolerance, many invisible walls of private intolerance continue to divide communities in entire countries, regions, cities, and boroughs. Now, some may be satisfied with a society like this.
However, if there are walls, there is no true peace, but only the kind of quiet conflict avoidance you find in a zoo, where animals co-exist harmoniously as long as they are kept in cages. In fact, we could refer to these circumstances as the ?zoo? state (Figure 84), and this is, perhaps, an inevitable phase for a community where people want to keep each other safe while controlling their most violent behaviours.
Nonetheless, it is important to treat this as a temporary condition because eventually it should be possible to move on together, towards a time where we can interact with everyone in the same way we do in our own homes. Not just in a state of law-enforced public tolerance, but in one of widespread, private tolerance. Indeed, we may name a community without private intolerance, as a ?home? state (Figure 84), in the sense that we treat each other with the same respect and love we show towards our own family members. So, how do we move to such a state? Let?s find out.
From Complete Intolerance to Peace
If you look back at Figure 84, you can see how, in a ?zoo-like? society, there is neither physical nor verbal exchange, as communities are willing to keep themselves separated to avoid any conflict, even in the form of a simple argument. We have discussed this in the previous chapter, where it was pointed out how ?quiet living? by conflict-avoidance can become an attractive option. Nonetheless, we have also highlighted how this is not an effective long-term strategy, as all the unresolved disagreements can eventually manifest themselves rather abruptly.
Therefore, if speech?that is, verbal exchange?does not resume, the ?zoo? remains the only alternative to the ?jungle.? Indeed, to proceed to a state of true peace, where conflict is not just suspended or ?walled-off,? people need to speak to each other again, facing their disagreements. One of the first steps is to address any underlying sentiment of discrimination by dismantling it at its deepest roots?where individuals first fail to give each other enough credit to be right on moral issues. In other words, achieving peace requires not only protecting free speech but also ensuring that it remains open-minded.

A Theological Root of Discrimination
Religious followers practicing forgiveness, kindness, tolerance, and compassion, may feel that the next analysis is an unfair depiction of their doctrine. However, this is not an accusation towards their entire value-hierarchy, but a criticism against a specific type of judgement occurring when people are regarded as inadequate?in particular, morally inadequate?based on their creed rather than their character and contributions. 
Unfortunately, it is a religious belief that God Himself sanctions this kind of judgment, when He splits the souls into two eternal factions?that is, hell and heaven (Figure 85)?according to their allegiance to Him. So, by faithfully following God?s example, religions project such a celestial line of separation down to Earth, becoming a doctrine of terrestrial divide between the ?doomed? and the ?blessed.? 
Figure 85: The Origin of the Religious Wall

Surely, if God says: ?love for humanity is the most important thing, not me? then a divine doctrine is not discriminatory, as God will eventually judge people for their love, not their creed. But, for many the belief is that God is the most important thing in life and if they wilfully and conclusively renounced Him they would end up in hell. And, given that hell means eternal agony, it would be difficult for any believer to dismiss this as a secondary issue. Unfortunately, not love or peace, but God?s judgement, hell and heaven, can become the dominant factors in people?s lives.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
In practice, when people do not declare allegiance to God, or even the ?same God,? they can become victims of intolerance. The law can protect them from any form of public discrimination, but it does not reach into the minds and hearts of communities who can maintain a more private intolerant attitude towards non-believers. This usually manifests itself in the form of failed human relationships, and more in general, a protracted failure of social integration. 
A clear example of private intolerance is the struggle around interfaith marriages, which could otherwise be the greatest catalyst for social integration and peace. This kind of union is hard to achieve, and indeed sometime shows how religions can become great dividers. In fact, if a person claims to love someone else, but does so outside divine instructions, their feelings are to be considered somewhat ?less than love,? ?not true love,? or ?not love at all.? This is because religious communities would split a couple into ?believer? and ?non-believer,? a partition more profound than their mutual feelings, and deeper than the sense of social equality born out of the conviction that they are both ?Children of God.? Put bluntly, if, on the one hand, the love for people can be a powerful unifier, on the other hand, the love for God can be a powerful divider.
How precious would it be for peace if everyone endorsed, without prejudice, the unexpected ?sparkles? of deep affection between members of opposite communities? Consider when people of different ethnicities fall in love and have children together. If this happens repeatedly across generations, racial supremacy would soon become a thing of the past. If the same happened between members of different faiths, religions would soon merge into one formidable community, where no single creed would matter more than humanity itself.

?Love your neighbour as yourself??Matthew 22:37-39 (New Testament)

What?s Wrong with Religion?
Religions are not completely wrong; indeed, they have provided essential sources of wisdom, insight, and moral guidance throughout human history. The world's holy texts represent millennia of accumulated reflections on human nature, ethics, community, and existential purpose. Much can be learned?and rediscovered?from the profound narratives, metaphors, and philosophical inquiries preserved within these traditions.
Nevertheless, not all religious teachings have aged equally well, and some propositions must be critically reconsidered in the light of contemporary science, philosophical logic, and evolving ethical standards. In the following section, I summarise specific criticisms discussed throughout this book, addressing issues ranging from scientific inaccuracies?such as creation myths?to problematic approaches regarding purpose and meaning. I also examine moral doctrines that, despite their unifying intentions, can sometimes foster division, discrimination, or absolutism.
My intention is neither to dismiss religion wholesale nor to diminish its significance. Rather, I aim to highlight areas that require thoughtful change, enabling religions to better serve humanity as consistent forces for peace, tolerance, and meaningful coexistence.
Science and Truth
It was never the objective of this book to challenge the many scientific claims religions make about the nature of the sun, Earth, evolution, the origin of life, biology, and so on. I focused, however, on one key cosmological proposition?the notion of divine creation?seeking to demonstrate that it is impossible and self-contradictory. Nonetheless, I pointed out that it is still feasible to maintain a belief in a God who lives in the universe and beyond?who is not the creator?but could be, for example, an infinitely powerful and knowledgeable entity.
I defined science as a belief system based on evidence, which chases the truth by adhering to the closest possible relationship with reality. Surely, evidence does not guarantee absolute certainty?with the exception of the notion of diversity and eventually eternity. Nonetheless, a state of evidence-based uncertainty is still a more thoughtful and comprehensive way to live and approach reality than by ignoring or dismissing possibilities?which would only keep us in a state of nave certainty, typical of dogma.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Purpose and Happiness
Religions do not hold a monopoly on answers to the meaning of life or on how we can find true fulfilment and happiness. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to still hear that without God life has no value, and our existence is pointless. Over the preceding chapters, I have tried to highlight why this proposition is actually wrong, and why purpose and meaning are functions of our emotions, which do not depend on faith or allegiance to any specific doctrine.
Free Will and Punishment
Over the course of this book, we have concluded that our choices and destiny are ultimately predetermined. There is, therefore, no complete free will. Yet we feel free because we cannot disagree with the outcome of the chain reaction that leads to our choices?this is because we are an integral part of the chain, not a spectator. Moreover, we feel free because when we choose something, we do so without ever knowing the fixed outcome ahead of us.
Crucially, given the lack of free will, if there is a God (not a creator), He should not hold us morally responsible for our actions. Indeed, even though mere mortals need to adopt a form of artificial mutual accountability to create a rule of law and avoid anarchy, the same cannot be said of an omnipotent being?who could easily educate us into better people instead.
Lastly, the very existence of a final judgement raises the concern that God?s love for mankind is ultimately conditional.
The Afterlife
Religions do not hold a monopoly on hope, either?especially with regard to our desire to conquer death. Indeed, immortality or the afterlife are not necessarily divine matters. In the future, humanity might be able to remain eternally alive by means of scientific progress.
Moreover, even if we cannot physically defeat mortality, the hope or belief in an afterlife does not require joining any specific doctrine. Anyone who desires to live beyond death is free to contemplate and wish for more life and happiness?this hope is free because every hope is. I concede that it is easier to hold on to any belief when shared with others, as is often the case in religious communities, but easier does not mean essential.
Morality
Morality is subjective?originating from within our hearts and minds, thoughts and feelings. Indeed, morality is an expression of ?likes? and ?dislikes? articulated by logic. The more interconnected the claims, the more likes, dislikes, and logic are required. This is what I refer to as the thought-feeling process, which leads to our behavioural preferences.
The claim that morality is objective is simply flawed. Surely, all written laws are objective tools?but their formulation and adoption depend on a subjective process of evaluation, which draws upon personal value hierarchies.
Now, this book is primarily a descriptive text, rather than prescriptive, in the sense that it aims to describe reality and seek the truth, rather than give instructions on what ought to be done. Yet, by pursuing agreement on what the description of morality is, it becomes possible to identify an antidote against systems that are not based on the correct underlying mechanism of morality.

Politics
A theocratic ideology is an absolutist response to the fear of relativistic anarchy, whereby?without a divine origin of morality?nobody can convert personal opinions into law. In fact, I wonder whether relativism exists primarily as a rhetorical excuse for endorsing authoritarian belief systems.
But moral persuasion does not require authority?only equal opportunity. Indeed, persuasion only requires authority when people convince themselves that it does, which is precisely the case in a theocratic mindset.
Unfortunately, religions often struggle to accept that their precepts could be wrong, or that anyone may hold an opinion more valuable than what is found in the holy texts. This close-minded approach can become antidemocratic whenever it reduces a debate to a clash against ?God?s will?, in which a believer is not open to the possibility that another?s opinion may be truer than what is stated in scripture.
In the most extreme scenario, a parliament exclusively filled with authority-based claims would eventually stop working and collapse?providing fertile ground for the rise of a theocratic government.

Peace
Religious followers can sometimes contribute to division by evaluating others primarily through the lens of shared beliefs, rather than fully appreciating their individual character, actions, and contributions to society. Unfortunately, this mindset creates barriers that even our strongest shared values and relationships may struggle to overcome. We only need to consider interfaith marriages, and how difficult they can be among opposing religious communities.
Public tolerance is often portrayed as a sign of peace?but this is far from enough. Peace can only occur when private intolerance is also overcome. Indeed, humanity can do far better than simply ignoring one another for the sake of quiet living.
Can Religion Change?
There are two fundamental changes that I advocate for religion: first, to turn from a theocratic to a humanistic system. Second, to turn from an absolutist to a democratic institution. Let us look at both in more detail.
From Theocratic to Humanistic Religiosity
In my opinion, the greatest problem with faith-based ideologies is the belief that God is more important than humanity?an idea that serves as a harmful seed, tilting religious creeds toward intolerance. A doctrine that upholds the superiority of God over people can be classified as theocratic religion, whereas one that rejects this hierarchy could be called humanistic religion. In other words, humanistic religiosity is defined by belief in God and the pursuit of a personal relationship with Him, but without the additional conviction that He is more important than humanity. Crucially, this does not mean that anyone should consider themselves more important than God either.
It is easy to see why people might place God above humans?He is, by definition, infinitely knowing, good, and powerful. But does this necessarily make Him more valuable than humankind?
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
The fundamental worth we assign to one another as human beings is not based on knowledge, power, or even moral goodness. We may admire those who are wise, strong, or virtuous?but admiration does not equate to superiority in nature. In any democracy, under the law, a genius is equal to someone less gifted; a professor is equal to a pupil; a strongman is equal to a child. We already understand what it means to reject discrimination and uphold equality?recognising the fundamental worth of every individual beyond their qualities or shortcomings.
So even if God is superior in every conceivable way, saying He is more important than humanity is not an automatic conclusion?it is a choice we make. Would you sacrifice your own child simply because God instructed it? I would not, because I choose to value my child above any command from an infinite-size divinity. Ultimately, it is up to us to recognise our own worth and refuse to see ourselves as inferior beings?regardless of how much love, respect, or even fear we may have for God.
From Absolutist to Democratic Religiosity
The second harmful seed too often sown by religion is the close-minded use of scriptures. While ancient holy texts contain undeniable wisdom, not everything within them is correct?most notably, the claim that God is the creator. I hope this not-so-minor error serves as a compelling reason to question the assumed divine infallibility of these books.
Moreover, the claim that a text is divinely authored is destined to remain an unsupported opinion, as no one can prove omniscience. But why assert this in the first place? The only advantage of declaring a set of rules as unquestionably authored by God is that it grants authority?and, more broadly, added value?to certain moral preferences. However, in a democracy, the same ethical principles can be valued and promoted based on their content, rather than their divine origin?something any non-authoritarian thinker would naturally do.
With this mindset, invoking God is not a prerequisite for being right?and even when one does, they can still be wrong.
Who Are You?
I hope that this book has, at the very least, stimulated and perhaps challenged your belief system. I can also reassure you that if you find yourself doubting the validity of your faith and decide to step away from it, you are not alone. In fact, you will most probably fall into the arms of another community of like-minded people.
So, are you religious or spiritual? Are you an atheist or a humanist? Let me help you understand what some of the options are.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Atheism
I consider myself an atheist. In fact, a strong atheist, as I do not simply believe there is no God or that there is no evidence for Him?I know He does not exist. But I can be a strong atheist only with regard to the Creator. There are thousands of other kinds of gods that people can believe in?alternative divine beings which are not disproved.
In fact, if you believe in an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, loving God and engage in a relationship with Him?even if you accept that He is not the creator?you could consider yourself religious.
Spirituality
I use the term spirituality to describe the belief that there may be a supernatural dimension or a great force in the universe and beyond?perhaps even conscious?which is extremely mysterious in nature and elusive to current science.
People might call this 'God', or simply refer to it as a force or entity. Personally, I concede that such a thing may indeed exist?but I have no desire to seek a personal relationship with it. If I did, however, I would consider myself religious.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Humanism
It is necessary to understand that atheism is not a container of morality or guidance. It is merely a claim that denies the existence of God, or the evidence for it.
Humanism, on the other hand, supports a set of principles?including the belief that people should not regard any deity as more important than human nature. Traditionally, humanists are also atheists?but what I hope to have highlighted here is that this is not an essential requirement, as people could maintain their faith in God without believing humans to be inferior to Him.
In other words, humanism specifically challenges the theocratic and antidemocratic aspects of religion?but it does not necessarily oppose belief in the divine or the endorsement of scriptures.
A Final Message
Throughout history, religious thought has provided meaning, structure, and community, guiding civilisations through uncertainty. It has shaped art, law, and morality, offering frameworks for exploring our place in existence.
Yet as humanity evolves, our understanding of reality must evolve as well. Zero Complexity has examined the fundamental nature of existence, demonstrating that while religious traditions have profoundly influenced cultures, the concept of a creator God is logically unsustainable.
Societies flourish when they seek and share truths grounded in logic and evidence, whereas those holding to unfounded beliefs and presumed infallibility risk division and stagnation.
The challenge ahead is to cultivate a world where reason and compassion coexist?where intellectual honesty thrives without dismissing the institutions that shaped us.
Our responsibility is not to tear down but to build; to move beyond inherited assumptions and seek knowledge without fear. Yet, in pursuing knowledge, we must not lose sight of what makes us human. Our search is not solely for ideas but for meaning. We need love, compassion, beauty, kindness, and hope?values transcending any single belief system.
Religion can continue to offer community and guidance, but never at the expense of our shared humanity or through demands for unquestioning submission. We must remain open to criticism and resist the temptation to declare any idea, institution, or figure naturally infallible, for perfection is something to discover, not assume.
To rise above conflict, we must embrace reason and empathy?the courage to seek and the wisdom to listen.

Appendix: Stress Test of the Argument from Diversity
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
The Argument from Diversity (AD), as developed throughout Zero Complexity, rests on five foundational claims?or ?pillars??which together form a logical sequence intended to exclude creation, deny a first intelligence, and dissolve the idea of a designed universe. This appendix undertakes a systematic and thorough AI-driven testing of each of those pillars. Rather than assume their strength, each is subjected to pressure from across the philosophical spectrum: classical metaphysics, modern scepticism, theology, idealism, mysticism, Eastern non-duality, post-structuralism, information theory, and contemporary physics. The aim is to determine whether any pillar breaks under the weight of history?s most serious objections.
Pillar 1: Diversity Exists
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Claim:
Difference is undeniably present. The Argument from Diversity does not claim that diversity is necessary in all possible worlds or foundational to being. It makes a simpler, more immediate claim: diversity exists here, now. To deny this is to rely on contrast?between truth and falsehood, illusion and reality, sameness and otherness. Every denial, every doubt, every alternative uses difference to operate. Thus, diversity is not merely observable?it is logically inescapable.

1. Parmenides ? Being Is One
Position: All is one. Change and plurality are illusions.
Challenge: If reality is undivided, then diversity is false.
Response: To call something an illusion is to distinguish it from truth. That distinction is itself a form of difference. Even monism must rely on contrast to describe itself.
Verdict: The denial of diversity affirms it. Pillar 1 affirmed.

2. N?g?rjuna ? Emptiness of All Categories
Position: All things lack inherent essence. Difference is empty.
Challenge: If difference has no true nature, it may not exist.
Response: Even emptiness is defined by contrast?between essence and non-essence, between form and void. N?g?rjuna?s method (catu?ko?i) depends on difference to function.
Verdict: Structural contrast is indispensable. Pillar 1 affirmed.

3. Berkeley ? Idealism
Position: Only minds and ideas exist; matter is unreal.
Challenge: If all is mind, difference may be subjective or illusory.
Response: Perceived differences are still differences. Sensations, ideas, and mental contents are not identical. Idealism preserves structural diversity.
Verdict: Relocation, not elimination, of difference. Pillar 1 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

4. Sextus Empiricus ? Radical Scepticism
Position: All claims are uncertain. Knowledge must be suspended.
Challenge: If certainty is impossible, then difference may not be knowable.
Response: Scepticism relies on contrast?between belief and suspension, appearance and truth. Even doubt requires difference.
Verdict: Suspicion confirms structure. Pillar 1 affirmed.

5. Plotinus ? The One and Its Emanations
Position: The One is undivided; multiplicity arises from it.
Challenge: If all diversity is derivative, it may not be real.
Response: Plotinus accepts difference in emanated realms. If the One differs from its emanations, difference already exists.
Verdict: Hierarchical metaphysics preserves contrast. Pillar 1 affirmed.

6. Wittgenstein ? Limits of Language
Position: Language defines the limits of thought. Some things cannot be said, only shown.
Challenge: Perhaps diversity is a linguistic construct, not a metaphysical reality.
Response: Language only works through difference: signs vs signs, sounds vs sounds, words vs meanings. Even if diversity is linguistic, it is structurally indispensable.
Verdict: Difference underpins both language and silence. Pillar 1 affirmed.

7. Derrida ? Diffrance
Position: Meaning is generated through deferred difference?never fully present.
Challenge: If meaning is always unstable, perhaps difference is never real.
Response: Derrida?s entire method affirms difference?not as stable identity, but as relational structure. Instability is not sameness.
Verdict: Infinite deferral still requires contrast. Pillar 1 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


8. Kant ? Noumenal Ignorance
Position: We cannot know reality as it is, only as it appears.
Challenge: If all knowledge is mediated, diversity may be a feature of our minds.
Response: Even mediated perception is structured. The distinction between phenomenon and noumenon presupposes difference.
Verdict: Epistemic limits do not dissolve structure. Pillar 1 affirmed.

9. Heidegger ? Being and Beings
Position: Being is prior to entities. Difference arises in disclosure.
Challenge: If Being is not a being, perhaps it precedes structure.
Response: Heidegger?s thought depends on distinctions: Being vs beings, authentic vs inauthentic, concealment vs presence. Difference is embedded in his framework.
Verdict: Ontological contrast is irreducible. Pillar 1 affirmed.

10. Advaita Ved?nta ? Non-Dual Consciousness
Position: Only Brahman is real; all distinctions are illusion.
Challenge: If all is one, then difference is false.
Response: The path to non-duality uses structured negation: neti neti (?not this, not that?). Even illusion requires a contrast with reality.
Verdict: Transcendence is reached through difference. Pillar 1 affirmed.

11. Zhuangzi ? Dream and Indeterminacy
Position: The boundaries between reality and illusion are fluid; all distinctions are provisional.
Challenge: If difference itself can?t be fixed?if you can?t distinguish dream from waking?how can diversity be affirmed?
Response: The paradox of indistinguishability relies on contrast. The claim this and that may be the same presupposes this and that as terms of reference. Zhuangzi?s fluidity does not dissolve difference?it deepens it.
Verdict: Ambiguity requires distinction. Pillar 1 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

12. David Bohm ? Implicate Order
Position: Reality is an undivided whole; apparent differences unfold from a deeper, hidden order.
Challenge: If all difference is surface illusion, perhaps diversity isn?t truly real.
Response: Even if differences emerge from a deeper wholeness, they are still structurally operative. Bohm?s theory doesn?t erase difference?it explains how it arises.
Verdict: Unfolding difference is still difference. Pillar 1 affirmed.

13. Jean Baudrillard ? Simulation and Hyperreality
Position: In a world of signs, difference is no longer grounded in real distinctions?it is simulated.
Challenge: If all difference is simulated, then nothing is truly different.
Response: Simulation itself depends on contrast: between sign and referent, original and copy, image and absence. Even the critique of difference relies on structured oppositions.
Verdict: Simulated difference is structurally real. Pillar 1 affirmed.

14. Heidegger (Second Challenge) ? Being as Prior to Beings
Position: Being is not a being; it precedes ontic difference.
Challenge: If Being is prior to difference, then perhaps diversity is derivative and illusory.
Response: Heidegger?s own analysis depends on the ontological difference between Being and beings. His system originates difference rather than erasing it.
Verdict: The ground of difference is still structured through it. Pillar 1 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

15. Lacan ? The Symbolic and the Lack
Position: Subjectivity is structured through symbolic lack and the Other.
Challenge: If the subject is formed through absence, not presence, does difference still count?
Response: Lacan?s very idea of the lack is differential. The Other, the signifier, and the symbolic order are all defined relationally. His system radicalises difference, not abolishes it.
Verdict: Absence is difference structured. Pillar 1 affirmed.

Resolution:
Every attempt to deny difference?whether mystical, sceptical, linguistic, or metaphysical?relies on it to be coherent. Diversity is not asserted as necessary in all possible worlds. It is claimed as a present, undeniable structure. Even to say there is only one requires contrast with not one. Diversity exists?not as a hypothesis, but as a condition of meaning.
Pillar 2: There Is No Third Reality
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
Claim:
All realities must be either structured (diverse) or unstructured (equal). There is no third structural condition. Anything that contains any difference?external or internal?is already a form of diversity. Anything that contains no difference whatsoever is equality. These two categories are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. The Argument from Diversity does not describe their substance, origin, or meaning?it simply claims that these are the only two structural forms reality can take. The idea of a ?third kind of reality? is either incoherent or reducible to one of the two.

1. Aristotle ? Actuality and Potentiality
Position: Reality consists of things that are either fully actual or potentially so.
Challenge: Could potentiality be a third kind of reality?neither diverse nor equal?
Response: Potentiality, by definition, is a mode of something else. When unrealised, it is undifferentiated and passive?equality. When realised, it becomes structured?diversity. It does not form a third category but shifts between the two.
Verdict: Potentiality belongs to the existing binary. Pillar 2 affirmed.

2. Plato ? The Realm of Forms
Position: The Forms are eternal, abstract realities beyond the physical world.
Challenge: Could the world of Forms be a third kind of reality?neither equal nor diverse?
Response: Each Form is distinct from every other Form. That is structural diversity, even if abstract. Plato?s metaphysics operates within difference.
Verdict: Ideal abstraction is still structured difference. Pillar 2 affirmed.

3. Kant ? The Noumenon
Position: The thing-in-itself is unknowable; we only perceive phenomena.
Challenge: Could the noumenon be something other than diversity or equality?something wholly ?other??
Response: If the noumenon differs from phenomena, then it is structurally different?hence, diverse. If it contains no distinctions at all, it is equal. There is no conceptual space for a third condition.
Verdict: The unknowable is still subject to structural logic. Pillar 2 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


4. Leibniz ? The Monads
Position: Reality is composed of simple, indivisible substances?monads.
Challenge: If monads have no parts, perhaps they are a third mode of being.
Response: Monads are distinct from each other. That alone makes them part of a structured, diverse reality. Their simplicity is internal, not relational.
Verdict: Multiplicity confirms diversity. Pillar 2 affirmed.

5. Spinoza ? God as Infinite Substance
Position: There is only one substance?God or Nature?with infinite attributes.
Challenge: Could this single substance be something other than equality or diversity?
Response: Spinoza?s attributes and modes are differentiated. Even if the substance is singular, its expression is structured. That structure is diversity.
Verdict: Oneness with structure is structured oneness. Pillar 2 affirmed.

6. Wittgenstein ? The Unsayable
Position: The limits of language are the limits of the world; some things can only be shown.
Challenge: Could the unsayable lie outside both diversity and equality?
Response: To be unsayable is still to be in contrast with what is sayable. That is a difference. If it has no contrast at all, it collapses into sameness.
Verdict: Even silence is framed by structure. Pillar 2 affirmed.

7. David Lewis ? Modal Realism
Position: All possible worlds are equally real; this world is one among many.
Challenge: If infinite realities exist, the Argument from Diversity may only apply to this one?not universally.
Response: Modal variation doesn?t escape the binary. Every world must be either structured (diverse) or unstructured (equal). The argument maps structural necessity, not narrative content.
Verdict: The duality governs all modal space. Pillar 2 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


8. Taoism ? The Tao Beyond Naming
Position: The Tao is the source of all, yet beyond categories and language.
Challenge: Could the Tao be a third kind of reality?beyond difference and sameness?
Response: If the Tao gives rise to Yin and Yang, it contains the potential for distinction. If it is entirely undivided, it is equality. Taoist metaphors oscillate between these two poles.
Verdict: The Tao flows within the binary, not beyond it. Pillar 2 affirmed.

9. Buddhism ? ??nyat? (Emptiness)
Position: All things are empty of intrinsic nature; forms are not ultimately real.
Challenge: Could emptiness be a structural third?a kind of groundless ground?
Response: Emptiness is always defined in relation to form. Even as a deconstruction of essence, it retains a structural role in Buddhist logic.
Verdict: Emptiness still participates in contrast. Pillar 2 affirmed.

10. Quantum Superposition ? Blurred States
Position: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
Challenge: Could superposition represent a state that is neither same nor different?
Response: Superposition involves measurable probabilities and relational distinctions. It is complex, not featureless. It belongs to diversity, not beyond it.
Verdict: Quantum states are structured states. Pillar 2 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

11. Graham Priest ? Dialetheism and True Contradictions
Position: Some contradictions are true; the law of non-contradiction does not hold universally.
Challenge: If reality can be both A and not-A, perhaps it escapes the binary of difference and sameness.
Response: Priest?s dialetheism still presupposes structure?it identifies contradictions within a framework of distinction. Even paradoxical coexistence relies on definable opposites.
Verdict: Contradiction depends on contrast. Pillar 2 affirmed.

12. Hegel ? Dialectical Becoming
Position: Reality unfolds through dialectical synthesis?Being, Nothing, and Becoming.
Challenge: If opposites always produce a third, the binary of equality/diversity may be incomplete.
Response: Synthesis requires prior distinction?negation, opposition, tension. Even Becoming is a contrast-born movement. There is no emergence without structured difference.
Verdict: Dialectic unfolds within diversity. Pillar 2 affirmed.

13. Whitehead ? Process Over Substance
Position: Reality is not composed of fixed things but ongoing events (?actual occasions?).
Challenge: If being is pure becoming, perhaps it escapes both equality and diversity.
Response: Process metaphysics replaces substance, but not structure. Each occasion is distinct; their relations are differentiable. Change itself requires difference.
Verdict: Becoming presupposes difference. Pillar 2 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

14. Meister Eckhart ? Ground Beyond God
Position: In the depths of the soul, there is a unity beyond being?pure divine ground.
Challenge: Could this ineffable ?ground? be a third mode?neither structured nor void?
Response: Even mystical silence occurs in contrast to perception, form, and concept. Eckhart?s ground is known through negation and transcendence, which presuppose structure.
Verdict: The beyond is framed through contrast. Pillar 2 affirmed.

15. Quentin Meillassoux ? The Great Outdoors (Speculative Realism)
Position: Correlationism wrongly assumes we cannot access reality outside thought.
Challenge: If reality is radically contingent, might it be structurally unknowable?neither same nor different?
Response: Even contingency requires a backdrop of contrast. To claim a reality is unknowable is to assert its distinctness from knowability. That is difference.
Verdict: Absolute contingency still implies distinction. Pillar 2 affirmed.

Resolution:
Every attempt to describe a third structural category?something that is neither diverse nor equal?falls back into one or the other. Abstract unity collapses into sameness. Complex systems, even if mysterious or dynamic, belong to difference. There is no coherent structural ?third?. Either something is distinguishable, or it is not. That is the full extent of structural logic.
Pillar 3: A First Reality Must Be One of Equality 
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Claim:
If diversity has not always existed?if it had a beginning?then the first state must have been entirely without difference. That is, it must have been equal in the strongest possible sense: lacking internal variation, relation, structure, or contrast. A structured reality cannot emerge from nothing; it must either be eternal or arise from a condition that contains no structure at all. This condition is what the Argument from Diversity identifies as pure equality. If diversity had a beginning, then the only coherent structural alternative to it is equality. There is no third category.


1. Aristotle ? The Unmoved Mover
Position: The first cause is pure actuality, not potentiality. It never changes but causes motion in others.
Challenge: If the first reality is active, not passive, why assume it was equal rather than diverse?
Response: The Argument from Diversity doesn?t claim equality is necessary?only that if diversity began, it must have come from a prior condition with no difference. An unmoved mover is not undifferentiated?it is fully actual and distinct. Therefore, it is already complex. That implies diversity is eternal, which is logically acceptable?but if not, we are back at equality.
Verdict: Challenge affirms the logic of AD?s conditional structure. Pillar 3 affirmed.

2. Aquinas ? God as Necessary, Simple, and Intelligent
Position: God is absolutely simple (without parts), yet also pure act and intelligence.
Challenge: If God is both first and simple, why not accept this as the first reality?without invoking equality?
Response: Simplicity without parts is not enough. Intelligence requires distinction?between subject and content, thought and not-thought. An intelligent being, however simple, must contain structure. Thus, it belongs to diversity.
If the first reality was intelligent, it could not be structurally simple. And if it was truly equal?no structure?it could not be intelligent.
Verdict: Theological simplicity collapses under structural necessity. Pillar 3 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


3. Spinoza ? God or Nature as Infinite Substance
Position: There is only one substance, with infinite attributes.
Challenge: Perhaps the first reality is structured, but singular?without parts or temporal division.
Response: A structured infinite substance is still structured. It contains internal differentiations: attributes, modes, expressions. If those differences are real, then the first reality is diverse. If they are not, then it is equal. There is no other option.
Verdict: Infinite complexity implies eternal diversity; otherwise, we return to equality. Pillar 3 affirmed.

4. Leibniz ? Principle of Sufficient Reason
Position: Everything must have a reason, even the first state.
Challenge: Why would equality exist at all? Why not a more structured or purposeful origin?
Response: Equality isn?t chosen?it?s what remains when all structured alternatives are excluded. The Argument from Diversity identifies it as the only non-diverse state. A condition with no distinctions has nothing within it to explain. The Principle of Sufficient Reason dissolves when applied to pure sameness.
Verdict: Reasoning ends where structure ends. Pillar 3 affirmed.

5. Hume ? Scepticism of Origins and Causation
Position: We cannot know ultimate causes; our knowledge is limited to habit and observation.
Challenge: Why assume any first state at all? Perhaps diversity is eternal.
Response: The Argument from Diversity fully allows for eternal diversity. It does not insist on a first state?only says that if there was one, it must have been equal.
This is a conditional claim, not an assertion of origin. It survives Humean scepticism by sidestepping causation.
Verdict: Objection anticipated. Pillar 3 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


6. N?g?rjuna ? Emptiness and the Rejection of Ontological Foundations
Position: All things lack inherent nature. Ultimate explanations are conceptually empty.
Challenge: A ?first reality? is just another conceptual construction. Why rely on it at all?
Response: AD does not claim to know or name the first reality?it simply maps logical categories. If something exists now, and if it did not always exist in differentiated form, then its precursor must have lacked difference. Even emptiness must be described in contrast to form or essence.
Verdict: Structural logic remains untouched by ontological silence. Pillar 3 affirmed.

7. Heidegger ? Being Beyond Categories
Position: Being is not a thing and cannot be captured by metaphysical binaries.
Challenge: ?Equality? is just another ontological category imposed on what precedes thought.
Response: Even Heidegger?s language presupposes difference: Being vs beings, concealment vs disclosure, authenticity vs inauthenticity.
If Being has no structure, it is equality. If it has internal distinctions, it is diversity. The binary remains unavoidable, even in anti-metaphysics.
Verdict: Being remains within the AD framework, despite its resistance. Pillar 3 affirmed.

8. Quantum Physics ? The Primordial Field or Vacuum
Position: The universe may have begun from a quantum vacuum, or an indeterminate energetic field.
Challenge: This starting point is not strictly diverse or equal?could it be a third state?
Response: A vacuum still has measurable properties, virtual particles, and fluctuation potentials. It is not structurally undifferentiated. If such a field exists, it is already a form of diversity.
If we propose a state with no measurable distinctions, it collapses into equality.
Verdict: Quantum physics begins after the binary split. Pillar 3 affirmed.

9. Advaita Ved?nta ? Brahman as the Non-Dual Absolute
Position: The ultimate reality is undivided, non-dual awareness.
Challenge: Brahman is neither equal nor diverse?it transcends these conceptual divisions.
Response: Even Advaita relies on negation and contrast: illusion vs reality, self vs not-self. If Brahman is truly featureless, it is structurally equal. If it is aware, then it contains difference. Either way, it lands inside the AD framework.
Verdict: Mystical transcendence cannot escape logical structure. Pillar 3 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


10. Bergson ? Reality as Pure Becoming
Position: There are no static substances?only duration, motion, and becoming.
Challenge: A first state may be a false framing. Perhaps everything is in motion from the start.
Response: If motion and change are eternal, then diversity is eternal?which the AD accepts. If not, then the condition preceding change must have had no parts, no transformation, no differentiation. That is equality.
Verdict: The binary framework again holds. Pillar 3 affirmed.

11. Hartle?Hawking ? No-Boundary Cosmology
Position: The universe began from a timeless, unbounded quantum state?no singular start.
Challenge: If time and causality dissolve, perhaps equality is unnecessary.
Response: The quantum model still invokes a prior condition. If it had no structure, it was equal. If it did, then diversity is eternal. Physics names it differently, but the logic remains binary.
Verdict: Timelessness is not structurelessness. Pillar 3 affirmed.

12. Maimonides ? Divine Simplicity
Position: God has no parts, no composition, no multiplicity?He is pure unity.
Challenge: If a being can be perfectly simple and yet active, maybe the origin wasn?t equality but divine simplicity.
Response: Simplicity that creates is no longer pure sameness?it contains latent contrast (e.g. will vs act, potential vs manifestation). Maimonides? God is metaphysically complex in function, even if simple in claim.
Verdict: Simplicity that acts is not structurally equal. Pillar 3 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

13. Whitehead ? Process Metaphysics
Position: God is eternal, evolving, and non-omnipotent?coexisting with the world rather than creating it.
Challenge: If God is not the origin but part of an eternal process, does this bypass the need for a first unstructured state?
Response: An evolving God is structured and intelligent?therefore part of diversity. If diversity is eternal, the AD stands. If it began, God cannot be first.
Verdict: Co-eternity confirms the binary. Pillar 3 affirmed.

14. Sri Aurobindo ? Consciousness as the Origin
Position: All things emerge from a transcendent, unmanifest consciousness?the Supermind.
Challenge: Could this unmanifest consciousness be neither equal nor diverse, but a reality that contains both?
Response: If the Supermind can differentiate, it contains internal complexity?whether latent or expressed. That is a form of pre-structural diversity.
Verdict: A generative source is not pure sameness. Pillar 3 affirmed.

15. Proclus ? The One Beyond Being
Position: The One is absolutely simple, beyond being, thought, and difference?yet from it emanates all things.
Challenge: Could something so radically prior produce difference without ever containing it?
Response: To cause is to contain. If The One gives rise to diversity, then it had the capacity for difference?either explicitly or implicitly. A pure equality cannot generate what it does not in some way possess.
Verdict: Emanation implies latent structure. Pillar 3 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


Resolution:
Pillar 3 does not claim that equality was the first reality?only that if diversity had a beginning, then it must have emerged from a state with no internal or external distinction. That is, a state of pure equality. All proposed alternatives?whether metaphysical, mystical, or abstract?ultimately resolve into one of two categories. If they contain any structure at all, they belong to diversity. If they are truly without structure, they are indistinguishable from equality.
Pillar 4: A First Reality Must Be Able to Change
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Claim:
If the first reality was a state of pure equality?without distinction, form, or relation?then it must have been capable of transformation. Since diversity exists now, either diversity is eternal, or it arose from equality. If it arose, then equality must have contained the potential to become different. A state of equality that cannot change would remain unchanged forever. Therefore, equality must have had some internal condition?such as undivided energy?that allowed it to shift. Otherwise, diversity could not exist.

1. Parmenides ? Change Is Impossible
Position: Reality is unchanging Being; change and difference are illusions.
Challenge: If true being cannot change, then equality could never transform.
Response: If change is truly impossible, then diversity cannot exist. But diversity does exist. Therefore, either Parmenides is wrong, or equality never occurred. In both cases, his challenge fails.
Verdict: Denial of change contradicts observed difference. Pillar 4 affirmed.

2. Heraclitus ? All Is Change
Position: Reality is flux. There is no fixed being?only becoming.
Challenge: If change is eternal, there is no need for a prior state of equality.
Response: The Argument from Diversity allows this possibility. If diversity is eternal, equality never existed. But if equality ever did exist, it must have changed.
Verdict: Alternate path, not a contradiction. Pillar 4 affirmed.

3. Hume ? No Necessary Causation
Position: Causality is not rationally necessary, only habitual.
Challenge: Why assume that a state of equality must transform?
Response: The argument doesn?t rely on cause, but on inference. If diversity exists, and if it came from equality, then equality was capable of transformation. This is a logical reconstruction, not a causal theory.
Verdict: The pillar survives Humean scepticism. Pillar 4 affirmed.

4. Leibniz ? Nothing Without a Reason
Position: All change requires a sufficient reason.
Challenge: What could possibly motivate a change from perfect equality?
Response: Pillar 4 does not invoke will or intent. If equality changed, it did so because it had the capacity. Undivided energy does not need a motive?it simply cannot remain unstructured forever.
Verdict: Structural potential substitutes for reason. Pillar 4 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

5. Aquinas ? God as Unchanging Creator
Position: God is changeless, yet causes the world by will.
Challenge: Creation need not come from equality?it can come from a timeless intelligence.
Response: Intelligence requires internal structure. An intelligent being cannot be purely equal. If the first state was structured, then it was already diverse. If it was equal, it could not have been a mind.
Verdict: Theistic creation violates structural simplicity. Pillar 4 affirmed.

6. Advaita Ved?nta ? Brahman as Unchanging Awareness
Position: Reality is pure awareness, without parts or change.
Challenge: Perhaps undivided awareness was the first reality, and change emerged within it.
Response: Awareness without object or relation is indistinguishable from unconsciousness. If Brahman changed, it was not purely equal. If it was purely equal, it was not aware.
Verdict: Non-dual awareness collapses into either structure or silence. Pillar 4 affirmed.

7. Quantum Physics ? Spontaneous Emergence
Position: Particles emerge spontaneously from quantum fields.
Challenge: Perhaps change arose without structure, from a quantum vacuum.
Response: The quantum vacuum is not pure equality. It contains fluctuating potentials and measurable differences. It is already a form of diversity.
Verdict: Physics presupposes structure. Pillar 4 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


8. Process Philosophy ? Becoming Is Primary
Position: Change is the most fundamental feature of reality.
Challenge: There never was equality; change is eternal.
Response: The argument allows this. If diversity never began, then equality never existed. But if equality did exist, it had to change.
Verdict: Compatible, not contradictory. Pillar 4 affirmed.

9. Plotinus ? Emanation as Overflow
Position: All things emanate from the One, which does not act or change.
Challenge: Perhaps change happened not by intent or cause, but by necessity of fullness.
Response: Emanation still implies that the One had the capacity to produce difference. That is structurally identical to change.
Verdict: Overflow is another name for transformation. Pillar 4 affirmed.

10. Cosmology ? Symmetry Breaking
Position: The early universe began in a state of perfect symmetry, which then broke.
Challenge: Why not see symmetry breaking as the start, without positing equality?
Response: Symmetry is equality. The breaking of it is transformation. Physics confirms the structure of the argument?it does not challenge it.
Verdict: Cosmology aligns with the logic. Pillar 4 affirmed.

11. Hegel ? Dialectical Becoming
Position: Reality unfolds through contradiction; Being and Nothing become Becoming.
Challenge: If change itself is the most primal synthesis, perhaps equality and diversity are both posterior to a deeper movement.
Response: Hegelian dialectic presupposes tension?negation, emergence, opposition. Even his synthesis is structured. If equality truly had no contrast, it could not enter dialectical relation.
Verdict: Dialectic requires opposites. Pillar 4 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

12. Teilhard de Chardin ? Evolution as Spiritual Unfolding
Position: The universe evolves toward increasing complexity and consciousness?the Omega Point.
Challenge: Could evolution itself be the eternal principle, making any initial state irrelevant?
Response: Evolution presupposes something to evolve. If diversity emerged, the initial state?whatever it was?had to support transformation. Teilhard?s cosmology aligns with, rather than contradicts, the pillar.
Verdict: Growth assumes changeable origin. Pillar 4 affirmed.

13. Ibn ?Arabi ? Divine Self-Disclosure (Tajall?)
Position: All existence is the unfolding of divine names?an eternal revelation of the One.
Challenge: If creation is God revealing Himself, perhaps the origin was both changeless and expressive.
Response: Revelation presupposes manifestation. If the One reveals, it differentiates. A changeless sameness cannot disclose?it can only remain.
Verdict: Disclosure implies capacity for difference. Pillar 4 affirmed.

14. Gilles Deleuze ? Difference as Primary
Position: Identity is the product of difference, not the other way around.
Challenge: Could change be fundamental, and any pure sameness illusory?
Response: Deleuze?s metaphysics strengthens the pillar. If difference is primal, then equality never existed. But if it did, it had to become different.
Verdict: Deleuze affirms the argument?s structure. Pillar 4 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

15. Mull? ?adr? ? Substantial Motion
Position: Existence itself is motion; being is inherently dynamic.
Challenge: Could motion be built into reality?s fabric in such a way that there was never static equality?
Response: If substantial motion is real, then the first reality never was pure equality. This does not threaten the pillar?it confirms its logical inverse.
Verdict: Motion affirms the need for transformability. Pillar 4 affirmed.

Resolution:
If diversity exists and did not always exist, then it must have emerged from something capable of becoming different. Equality of no energy cannot change. Therefore, the only plausible first state is equality of energy?pure, undivided, but able to transform. No challenge successfully proposes a changeless sameness from which difference could arise. Every coherent model affirms either eternal diversity or a changeable equality.
Pillar 4 stands.
Pillar 5: A First Reality Must Be Unintelligent
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

Claim:
If the first reality was a state of perfect equality?without any internal or external differences?then it could not have been intelligent. Intelligence, in every known form, requires structure: contrast, relation, distinction. Without these, no awareness, no thought, and no subject?object relation can exist. A mind with no parts is indistinguishable from no mind at all.

1. Aquinas ? God as Pure Act and Intelligence
Position: God is utterly simple, yet fully intelligent. His knowing is one timeless act.
Challenge: If God can be both undivided and intelligent, then perhaps intelligence does not require internal distinction.
Response: Even a single act of knowing presupposes contrast: between knower and known, thought and non-thought. Total sameness would eliminate all distinction, rendering intelligence inert. Aquinas? God contains implicit structure?and therefore belongs to diversity.
Verdict: Divine simplicity collapses under the requirements of intelligence. Pillar 5 affirmed.

2. Descartes ? Thought as the First Certainty
Position: Thinking is the foundational reality?Cogito, ergo sum.
Challenge: If mind is primary, perhaps intelligence does not depend on prior structure.
Response: The cogito presupposes distinction: between self and thought, presence and absence of thinking. Without contrast, the cogito loses meaning. Descartes? certainty confirms that intelligence begins with difference.
Verdict: Thinking cannot occur in pure sameness. Pillar 5 affirmed.

3. Plotinus ? The One Beyond Thought
Position: The One is beyond intellect and division; from it emanates structured mind.
Challenge: If the One is the source, perhaps pure unity can give rise to intelligence.
Response: Plotinus separates the One from intelligence explicitly. It is only the second principle?the Divine Mind?that thinks. The One itself is not intelligent.
Verdict: Unity and intelligence are distinct in his system. Pillar 5 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


4. Spinoza ? God as Infinite Intellect
Position: God is infinite substance, containing infinite thought.
Challenge: If all is one, perhaps intelligence can be undivided.
Response: Spinoza?s intellect is structured?its thoughts are distinct, its modes differentiated. Intelligence, even in his system, arises through internal relation.
Verdict: Infinite thought is still diverse thought. Pillar 5 affirmed.

5. Berkeley ? Reality as Divine Perception
Position: All things are ideas in the mind of God.
Challenge: If the world is mental, intelligence may precede structural difference.
Response: Perception requires contrast: between one idea and another, between subject and object. Berkeley?s divine mind is structurally rich.
Verdict: Idealism preserves diversity. Pillar 5 affirmed.

6. Advaita Ved?nta ? Brahman as Pure Awareness
Position: Ultimate reality is undivided, contentless consciousness.
Challenge: Perhaps awareness can exist without distinction.
Response: Awareness without object or contrast is indistinguishable from unconsciousness. Even Advaita depends on negation?neti neti?which requires structural difference.
Verdict: Consciousness without structure is not consciousness. Pillar 5 affirmed.

7. N?g?rjuna ? Emptiness of Self and Thought
Position: All things, including mind, are empty of intrinsic identity.
Challenge: If intelligence is empty, perhaps it can exist without structure.
Response: Emptiness deconstructs essence, not functional relation. N?g?rjuna still employs contrast and conditionality to describe thought. Intelligence remains structurally dependent.
Verdict: No refuge in emptiness. Pillar 5 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

8. Panpsychism ? Mind as Fundamental
Position: Consciousness is a basic feature of all matter.
Challenge: If mind is built into everything, perhaps it exists without structural difference.
Response: Even minimal awareness requires gradation and relation?states, sensations, experience. An undifferentiated, unchanging field is not awareness, but blankness.
Verdict: Proto-consciousness still requires difference. Pillar 5 affirmed.

9. Information Theory ? Intelligence as Computation
Position: Intelligence is information processing.
Challenge: If mind is just computation, can it exist in a structurally minimal form?
Response: Computation requires inputs, outputs, and states?each a form of difference. Without contrast, there is no process.
Verdict: Structure is the condition of computation. Pillar 5 affirmed.

10. William Lane Craig (following al-Ghaz?l?) ? The Kalam Cosmological Argument
Position: Whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist, so it has a personal Creator.
Challenge: If the first reality is intelligent and personal, it cannot be pure equality.
Response: Intelligence requires structure?distinctions like knower and known, will and act. A personal Creator presupposes difference. If the first state was equal, it could not be a mind.
Verdict: Kalam assumes structure. Pillar 5 affirmed.

11. Avicenna ? Necessary Being as Self-Knowing
Position: God is a necessary, simple being who knows Himself and all else through His essence.
Challenge: If simplicity and self-awareness coexist in God, then intelligence might not require structure.
Response: Avicenna?s God is not structurally simple in the strict sense used in the AD. Divine knowledge implies internal distinctions?between knower, knowing, and known. If that triad exists, the being is not purely equal.
Verdict: Awareness implies internal structure. Pillar 5 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).

12. Daniel Dennett ? Consciousness as Emergent
Position: Consciousness arises from complex, information-processing structures.
Challenge: If intelligence is emergent, then it cannot exist in an undifferentiated state.
Response: Dennett?s model supports the pillar: structure is a prerequisite for intelligence. If the first state had no complexity, it could not be aware.
Verdict: Emergence affirms the pillar. Pillar 5 affirmed.

13. Negative Theology ? The God Beyond All Attributes
Position: God transcends all concepts, names, and categories; He is ineffable and unknowable.
Challenge: If God is beyond structure, perhaps intelligence does not require difference.
Response: Even the claim of ineffability presupposes contrast?between what can and cannot be known, between speech and silence. Negative Theology still operates within a relational frame.
Verdict: The unknowable still depends on distinction. Pillar 5 affirmed.

14. Jiddu Krishnamurti ? Awareness Without a Thinker
Position: Pure awareness exists beyond the ego, beyond mental division.
Challenge: If awareness is possible without thought or conceptual structure, perhaps it doesn?t require difference.
Response: Krishnamurti?s choiceless awareness still implies contrast?between attention and inattention, between experience and absence. Awareness presupposes distinction, however subtle.
Verdict: Silent awareness is still relational. Pillar 5 affirmed.
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).


15. Whitehead ? Process Theology
Position: God is eternal, non-omnipotent, and evolves in relation to the world?His conceptual and physical poles mirror reality?s becoming.
Challenge: If God is not the creator but co-eternal with diversity, could divine intelligence exist without contradicting the AD?
Response: If God is structured and intelligent, He belongs to diversity. If He is unstructured, He cannot think. Process Theology avoids creation, but not structure. It concedes eternal diversity?and thus affirms the pillar by implication.
Verdict: Co-eternity admits the binary. Pillar 5 affirmed.

Resolution:
Every attempt to describe intelligence without structure either reintroduces difference or collapses into unconsciousness. Intelligence is not simply something that exists?it is a relational process. Without distinction, it cannot arise. The first reality, if it was equal, could not have been intelligent. And if it was intelligent, it was already diverse. There is no middle ground.
Pillar 5 stands.
Conclusion
The Argument from Diversity has now been subjected to rigorous philosophical pressure from multiple angles: metaphysical, theological, epistemological, mystical, physical, and linguistic. It has faced monism, dualism, non-dualism, materialism, idealism, scepticism, panpsychism, process philosophy, and theological essentialism. It has been tested against thinkers who deny change, reject categories, affirm pure becoming, posit divine simplicity, and assert the ineffability of the Real.
In every case, the structure of the argument has held. Each of the five pillars?that diversity exists; that no third structural condition is possible; that equality must precede diversity if diversity had a beginning; that equality must have the capacity to transform; and that intelligence requires structure?has been affirmed either directly or through the failure of challenges to displace them.
Where objections have sought to replace the binary, they have fallen back into it. Where thinkers have proposed exceptions, they have presupposed the very distinctions they deny. Where metaphysical systems aim to transcend structure, they inevitably reintroduce contrast through negation, function, or expression.
The Argument from Diversity does not rest on theology, tradition, or speculation. It maps the logical conditions required for structure, transformation, and meaning. Its claim is modest but absolute: if anything exists with difference, then structure is real. If structure began, it could only emerge from something without structure. If that origin was truly unstructured, it could not be intelligent. If it was intelligent, it was already structured. There is no escape from the logic.
This stress test does not prove that diversity had a beginning, nor that equality preceded it. But it demonstrates that any coherent account of origin, intelligence, or reality must conform to one of two structural forms: diversity or equality. Nothing in between is sustainable. Nothing beyond is meaningful.
In this way, the Argument from Diversity does not collapse under scrutiny?it is sharpened by it.

Glossary
This content is part of the original philosophical framework developed by Robin Mains inÿZero Complexityÿ(2025).
This glossary defines key terms used throughoutÿZero Complexity, many of which are original to this work or represent redefined versions of classical concepts. Each entry has been crafted to clarify not only the meaning of the term itself, but also its role within the book?s broader philosophical framework?particularly the Argument from Diversity, the principleÿDiversitas ante Verbum, and the model of the eternal switch.
The glossary serves both as a reference tool and as a conceptual map, helping readers trace the interrelations between ontology, epistemology, identity, and meaning. Where relevant, definitions link across ontological and epistemological domains, highlighting how the experience of reality depends on underlying structures of difference, detection, and complexity.
All terminology presented here has been developed or refined in the context of this system, and should be understood within the philosophical architecture introduced throughout the book.
Absolutism
An ideological framework in which moral or legal authority is derived from a fixed, untouchable source—often a religious text or presumed divine origin. Absolutism obstructs legislative reform, overrides personal judgment, and violates the principle that all are equal above the law.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Aesthetic Goodness
A positive emotional response to sensory or conceptual stimuli—such as beauty, taste, or artistic expression. Aesthetic judgement is rooted in emotion rather than correctness or empathy. 
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Afterlife 
The notion of continued existence after physical death. In this text, it is framed as a source of hope that does not require adherence to any specific religious doctrine.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Agent-Based Creation
The hypothetical process whereby an external entity creates energy or existence from a state of nothingness. Argued to be logically impossible due to the absence of any acting agent within true nothingness.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
All Are Equal Above the Law
A principle of social equality stating that all individuals, regardless of background, have the right to participate in the making of laws—typically through persuasion and democratic processes. It affirms universal agency in shaping legal standards.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
All Are Equal Under the Law
A principle of social equality stating that all individuals are equally subject to the law’s rules and consequences. This requires a universal definition of personhood, grounded in emotion and consciousness rather than external traits.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
All-Negative Choice
A decision between two or more options, all of which elicit negative emotions. Action is guided by the desire to avoid the worst possible outcome—the lesser of two evils.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
All-Positive Choice
A decision between options that all elicit positive emotions. The choice is based on the strongest emotional pull among the desirable options.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Argument from Diversity
A logical framework consisting of five interdependent claims—referred to as pillars—that together demonstrate why the act of creation is impossible and why any first cause must be unintelligent. It serves as the structural foundation for rejecting the idea of a creator God in Zero Complexity. The argument emerges from the model of eternity and is grounded in the universal certainty of difference. The five pillars are as follows: (1) diversity exists; (2) there is no third reality beyond equality and diversity; (3) a first reality must be a state of equality; (4) a first reality must be capable of change; and (5) a first reality must be unintelligent. Each pillar is presented as logically necessary, such that the denial of any one of them results in contradiction or impossibility.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Atheism
The belief that there is no God or no evidence for God. A strong atheist claims to know that a specific God—especially a creator—is logically impossible, though other undefined or non-creator gods may remain conceptually open.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Attraction
A movement or tendency of one entity toward another, occurring with or without consciousness. In unconscious systems, attraction arises through physical forces such as gravity or magnetism. In conscious beings, it includes emotional or intellectual draw, often guiding intentional behaviour. All forms of attraction reflect a response to difference—whether through force or feeling.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Authority-Based Law
A legal or moral system justified not by persuasion or shared reasoning, but by reference to an authoritative source—such as divine command, tradition, or power. In Zero Complexity, such systems are contrasted with opportunity-based frameworks like democracy.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Behaviour
Any action or inaction performed by a subject, whether intentional or unintentional. Intentional behaviour involves choice; unintentional behaviour occurs without conscious decision.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Belief
A mental posture based on probability, defined by the expectation that carries the least degree of uncertainty when absolute certainty is not available.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Belief in God
The conviction that a deity exists and plays a role in creation, purpose, or morality. The book distinguishes this from God’s actual existence, emphasising that belief alone can elicit emotional purpose, regardless of theological truth.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Blind Field
The invisible region within one’s visual system where no light is detected; used as an experiential metaphor for the absence of difference in a state of equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Blindness
The complete equalisation of visual experience, where no distinction between visible forms exists. It results in visual silence—not darkness, but the absence of light and shape—producing an invisible visual field.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Celestial Divide
The theological concept of a final, irreversible split between souls—those rewarded with heaven and those condemned to hell—based on their allegiance to God. When mirrored socially, this divide becomes a structural source of earthly discrimination.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Certainty (primary and secondary)
Primary certainty is a naïve, unquestioned sense of truth, usually held by default. Secondary certainty is the explicit conviction that something cannot be otherwise, formed through logical analysis.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Chain Reaction
A sequence of causally connected events. Present in both unintentional physical systems (e.g. rocks falling) and intentional behaviour (e.g. evaluation leading to choice).
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Choice
The acknowledgment of a preference between two or more options. A choice requires comparative evaluation, guided by emotional responses of varying intensities.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Circular Argument
A logical fallacy in which the conclusion is assumed within the premise—for example, “The book is infallible because God wrote it, and we know God wrote it because the book is infallible.” Used to sustain religious claims without external validation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Closed-Mindedness
The rejection of an idea or argument based not on its merit but on prejudice against its source. A major obstacle to persuasion and peace, as it prevents meaningful dialogue and entrenches division.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Communication
The process whereby a sender transmits a label which, through shared definitions, evokes a matching experience in the receiver’s mind. Requires alignment between both parties' memorised definitions.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Comparative Model of Behaviour
A framework that unites intentional and unintentional behaviour by identifying shared features—such as chain reaction and force—while distinguishing between physical and emotional drivers.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Complete Equalisation
A state where all distinctions are entirely eliminated, resulting in perfect uniformity and undifferentiation. In Zero Complexity, it represents the final stage of equalisation, where identity, structure, and contrast cease to exist. Complete equalisation marks the end of differentiation, leaving no distinctions to be recognised.
Complex Evaluation
An evaluative process involving multiple factors, often including both primary and secondary subjects, each carrying its own emotional association.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Conditional Love
Love that is dependent on meeting certain expectations or conditions. In contrast to unconditional love, it implies withdrawal of affection or support if specific criteria are not fulfilled—such as divine love contingent on obedience or faith.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Conflict
A situation in which at least two individuals hold opposing behavioural preferences—either opposing the same behaviour or preferring opposite behaviours. Conflict is the experiential opposite of peace.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Conscious Agent
A subject capable of self-awareness and intentional behaviour, possessing the capacity to experience, evaluate, and choose between options.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Conscious Control
The influence exerted by self-conscious awareness through evaluative thought and emotional recognition. Limited in scope, as many influences on behaviour remain subconscious or physiological.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Consciousness
The presence of thoughts and experiences within a subject’s awareness. May exist in varying levels, from basic perception to full self-consciousness.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Consequential Value
Value arising from an effect or outcome linked to the primary subject. For instance, valuing a shirt because it prevents sunburn is a consequential association.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Contrast
A detectable difference between entities, signals, or states. It forms the foundational condition for identity, detection, and meaning. Without contrast, there can be no structure, awareness, or knowledge.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Control Centre (of the Mind)
The seat of conscious evaluation and decision-making. Distinguished from bodily systems and subconscious processes, which function independently of awareness.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Creation
Defined as a change ‘from nothing to something’. The text argues that all forms of creation—direct, self-, and agent-based—are logically incoherent when applied to true nothingness.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Creator God
A deity posited as the origin and ultimate explanation of the universe. According to the Argument from Diversity and the model of equality presented in Zero Complexity, such a being cannot exist as the first cause due to ontological complexity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Deafness
The complete equalisation of auditory experience, where no distinction between sounds can be perceived. It represents either the absence of sound or the inability to detect sound, rendering the auditory field silent.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Deep Persuasion
The process by which a conflicting preference is fundamentally removed through a change in underlying emotional orientation. This results in genuine agreement, not merely behavioural compliance.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Definition
The association between an experience and a label. A definition provides meaning to words and is foundational to both communication and truth.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Democracy
A system of governance in which all individuals are both subjects and shapers of the law—equal under and above it. Enables peaceful conflict resolution through persuasion rather than force.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Democratic Religiosity
A belief system that permits the reinterpretation of scriptures and doctrines through democratic discourse, rejecting absolutist claims and embracing evolving ethical standards.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Derived Value
Emotional value attached to a secondary subject that is linked to the origin or background of the primary subject—for example, sentimentality attached to a gift from a loved one.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Destiny
An unchangeable outcome within a causal chain. May be understood retrospectively (after the outcome) or prospectively (anticipated in advance). Predictability is limited by complexity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Diff
A coined term referring to the epistemological one—a minimal unit of identity or knowledge that exists only in contrast to another. A diff is not a difference itself, but a component of it; two diffs together constitute a difference, making recognition and knowledge possible. (See also Diversitas ante Verbum).
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Difference
The universal, inescapable property of reality that underpins all certainty and knowledge. It is the first logically undeniable truth.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Direct Creation
The claim that nothingness itself brings something into existence. Rejected on the grounds that nothingness lacks energy and thus the capacity for change.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Direction of Behaviour
The orientation of an agent’s action—toward or away from something—determined by the emotional values associated with available options. Driven by emotional attraction or repulsion.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Discrimination
The act of judging someone as unworthy or inadequate based on a partial or incomplete evaluation—typically by reducing a person to a single feature such as race, gender, class, or religion while ignoring their full character and contributions.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Diversification
The process by which a uniform or equal state transforms into distinguishable parts or identities—i.e., the emergence of diversity from equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Diversitas ante verbum
Latin for ‘diversity before the word’. Denotes the principle that contrast is a precondition for language, recognition, and knowledge.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Diversitas ante Verbum
Latin for ‘diversity before the Word’. Here applied not only to language and human knowledge, but to divine thought itself—asserting that even the Logos requires diversity to exist or be meaningful.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Diversity
A state characterised by difference—between things, events, or moments—necessary for identity, limits, space, and time. Associated with the infinite presence of time. It stands in contrast to equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Divine Judgement
The notion that God assesses and rewards or punishes human beings based on their beliefs and actions. The book critiques this concept as incompatible with a coherent model of intentional behaviour and free will.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Dogma
A belief asserted as absolutely true without being open to question or revision. In this text, dogma represents primary certainty masquerading as secondary certainty.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Emotion
The foundational experiential component underlying preference, purpose, and value. Emotion is the key ingredient that determines aesthetic appreciation, empathic sensitivity, and moral evaluation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Emotional Attraction
The pull or inclination toward a subject due to a dominant positive emotional association.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Emotional Equalisation
The process by which all emotions merge into a singular feeling (near equalisation) or fade into numbness (complete equalisation), eliminating emotional distinction.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Emotional Force
An internal driver—positive (attraction) or negative (repulsion)—that influences intentional behaviour, mirroring physical forces in non-sentient systems.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Emotional Repulsion
The push or aversion away from a subject caused by a dominant negative emotional association.

Emotional Response
The capacity of a subject or experience to evoke a meaningful emotional reaction. Proposed as the foundational ingredient of purpose, independent of religious belief.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Empathic Goodness
An emotional response to the feelings or emotional states of others. May be direct (observable cues) or indirect (imagined or remembered emotions). The basis for moral judgement.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Empathy
An emotional resonance with another being’s experience, especially suffering or joy. Empathy underpins moral valuation and is the foundation of both ethical behaviour and human rights.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Enforcement
The act of compelling behaviour through physical force, threat, or legal obligation, without necessarily changing internal beliefs or desires. Unlike persuasion, enforcement targets action, not conviction, and may suppress rather than resolve underlying conflict.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Epistemological One of One (“One”)
A hypothetical unit of recognition in a reality where only one thing exists—entirely without contrast. It corresponds to Ontological Zero or Ontological One, depending on whether something exists (uniformly) or nothing exists at all. In either case, detection becomes impossible, even subconsciously, as no diff can form. Without contrast, there is no recognition, no identity, and no knowledge.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Epistemological One of Two (“Two”)
A unit of knowledge formed through contrast—what may be called a diff. It is one half of a recognisable difference, made possible only when at least two distinct things exist. This state corresponds to Ontological Two, the minimal condition in which contrast becomes possible. Subconscious and conscious recognition alike depend on such difference: only from diversity can meaning arise.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Equalisation
A process of change in which diversities—whether physical, emotional, or cognitive—are removed, leading to uniformity. In Zero Complexity, equalisation describes the transition from diversity to equality, where all distinctions are eliminated. The process can be partial, where some differences remain, or complete, where all contrasts are erased, resulting in a fully undifferentiated state.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Equality
A state devoid of all difference—no parts, limits, or identities. Described as zero complexity and associated with the infinite absence of time. It stands in contrast to diversity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Equality (supernatural)
A dimensionless, undetectable, and undifferentiated supernatural state. Argued to be logically incapable of supporting identity, thought, or intelligence—hence incompatible with the traditional concept of God.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Equality of Energy
An undifferentiated, dimensionless state of energy and therefore with the potential for transformation into diversity. Can exist eternally and permit change. Proposed as the only plausible “first reality” in place of a creator God.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Equality of No Energy
A pure state of nothingness—undifferentiated, changeless, and inert. Cannot give rise to diversity or existence and therefore cannot be a creator or first cause.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Essential Value of Humanity
The intrinsic worth attributed to human beings based on their capacity for emotion and consciousness, not on traits such as status, culture, or belief. This value justifies equal treatment under and above the law.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Eternal Duality
The core metaphysical model in which all reality falls into one of two categories—diversity or equality—each capable of being eternal. All existence is argued to fall into one or the other. Religion is shown to unknowingly presuppose this model while misinterpreting it.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Eternal Switch
A metaphor used to model reality as alternating between states of diversity (ON) and equality (OFF). Illustrates the potential oscillation or transformation between structured and undifferentiated existence.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Evaluation
The process of assigning emotional value to experiences or options. All evaluation involves a thought-feeling process, where emotion determines worth.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Eve’s Choice
A symbolic reference to the biblical story of original sin. Used to illustrate how all intentional behaviour—including Eve’s disobedience—is governed by subconscious and emotional processes, undermining claims of ultimate moral responsibility.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Evidence
Anything that is not someone else’s description of reality. It includes what we directly perceive—what we see, hear, or feel—whether aided by instruments or not. Evidence can be personal (accessible only to the individual perceiving it) or shared (directly perceived by multiple individuals at the same time).
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Existence
In this context, the state of being defined either by diversity or equality. The definition is complicated when applied to equality of no energy, which is indistinguishable from non-existence.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Experience
Any conscious content of the self, either direct (sensory and emotional) or indirect (thoughts). Experiences serve as the evaluative field through which choices and values are shaped. Without experience, a label remains meaningless.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Experience (subjective vs objective)
Subjective experience happens within the mind, such as feelings or perceptions. Objective existence refers to that which exists independently of the mind, though it can never be experienced objectively.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Extended Self-Consciousness
A developed mental state in which awareness includes non-feeling parts of the body—such as hair, nails, or internal organs—physically linked to the feeling body.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Faith-Based Authority
The assertion of moral or legislative superiority based solely on religious texts or divine attribution. Critiqued for undermining open moral debate and democratic consensus.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Feeling-Body Consciousness
A level of self-awareness marked by the identification of one’s body as distinct from others, based on the localisation of sensations such as heat, touch, or pain.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Fifth Pillar: A First Reality Is Unintelligent
Intelligence presupposes structure, contrast, and content. In perfect equality, no such features exist. Therefore, the first reality—if it existed—must have been unintelligent.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
First Pillar: Diversity Exists
The foundational claim that everything differs from something else. Even attempts to deny diversity rely on contrast, reaffirming its existence. To think at all requires difference.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Fourth Pillar: A First Reality Is Able to Change
Given that diversity exists, the first reality—if it was equality—must have transformed. This requires energy, as pure nothingness is incapable of change.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Free Speech
The ability to express behavioural preferences, emotional evaluations, or opinions without suppression. Essential to the process of persuasion and thus foundational to lasting peace.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Free Will
The ability to acknowledge and act upon preferences. In Zero Complexity, free will is not absolute, as choices arise from causal sequences and subconscious factors beyond full control.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
God (Value-Hierarchy Model)
An alternative model in which ‘God’ symbolically represents whatever sits atop a person’s emotional value hierarchy. Criticised in the text for being conceptually ambiguous and inconsistent with traditional theological usage.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
God the Prime Changer
An attempted redefinition of God as a non-creator but initial transformer of existence. Dismissed as logically equivalent to a state of equality—thus incompatible with awareness or agency.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Hierarchy of Values
An ordered structure in which experiences, subjects, or options are ranked by the intensity of emotional response they elicit—positive or negative. Determines priority in choice and meaning.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Humanism
A philosophical and ethical stance prioritising human welfare, reason, and dignity over divine authority. In Zero Complexity, humanism may include theistic beliefs, provided they reject the superiority of God over humanity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Humanistic Religion
A form of religious belief that upholds faith in God while rejecting the notion that God is more valuable than humanity. Encourages spiritual practice without theocratic hierarchy.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Identity
The quality of being defined or distinguishable, which arises only through limits and difference. Cannot exist in a state of equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Illogic
A breakdown in the structure of thought, caused by contradiction or impossible concepts (e.g., ‘circular triangle’). Illogic reveals limits to language and cognition.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Immutable Law
A law that cannot be revised, challenged, or repealed—typically because its origin is believed to be divine, perfect, or unquestionable. Contrasted with reformable law, which evolves through persuasion and democratic consensus.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Infallibility
The claim that error is impossible. Distinguished from perfection, which means alignment with a defined standard. Infallibility is argued to be an unsupported opinion, especially when applied to religious texts.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Infinite Fulfilment
The belief that only an infinite being can satisfy the human desire for meaning. The book critiques this claim by noting that human thoughts and emotions are finite, and that literal absorption into infinity (as equality) would eliminate experience.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Infinity
Used in two senses: (1) Infinite diversity—a state with an endless extent of distinguishable components (e.g., stars in the universe); and (2) Infinite equality—a state with a complete absence of distinguishable components. Both represent forms of eternity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Instinct
A behavioural response driven by emotion, occurring without deliberate evaluative thought. Instincts are automatic but not reflexive, and may involve fear, hunger, or other primal drives.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Instrumental detection
The use of tools (e.g., sensors, cameras) to extend human perception. Though often helpful, such tools are still fallible and subject to misinterpretation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Intelligence (divine or natural)
Defined as a complex, structured capacity for thought, requiring diversity. Argued to be impossible in a state of equality, natural or supernatural.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Intention
The conscious selection of a behavioural path based on evaluation and emotional preference. Distinguished from reflex or instinct, which bypass choice.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Intentional Behaviour
Behaviour that results from conscious evaluation and choice between alternatives. Requires self-consciousness, experiential input, and preference formation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Interfaith Marriage (Philosophical Role)
A potential catalyst for peace and integration. When opposed by religious communities, such unions reveal the depth of doctrinal discrimination. When supported, they represent a triumph of human connection over inherited division.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Intolerance
A form of discrimination involving the rejection of others based on belief, identity, or background. It ranges from violent persecution to subtle private prejudice, and is distinguished by whether it manifests publicly (via action or law) or privately (via thought or interpersonal exclusion).
Label
A word or symbol used to represent an experience. Labels are necessary for communication but only meaningful when tied to actual or recalled experience.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Law
A rule enforced by a dedicated group, specifying expected behaviours in specific circumstances. Functions through enforcement, shallow persuasion, and occasionally supports deep persuasion via education.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Law Enforcement
The operational arm of a legal system, tasked with identifying violations of written rules and executing appropriate consequences. Officers are not responsible for agreeing with the law, only for applying it.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Legal Equality
The condition in which all individuals are equally governed by and able to influence the law. It encompasses both being subject to the law (under) and able to participate in lawmaking (above).
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Legal Responsibility
A practical, societal framework for assigning accountability. Described as a strategic simplification that disregards the deeper causes of behaviour in order to maintain order and enforce norms. Considered a functional construct rather than a metaphysical truth.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Legal Wall of Private Intolerance
The boundary beyond which legal systems cannot reach. While laws may prohibit public discrimination, they cannot compel private relationships, affections, or attitudes. Behind this wall, only persuasion and open speech can foster genuine tolerance.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Limit
The boundary that distinguishes one thing from another, essential for diversity and identity. Absent in equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Limitation (of Freedom)
Any internal or external influence—coercion, disease, manipulation, or physiology—that restricts or alters conscious evaluation and choice.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Logic
The internal structure of thought that preserves coherence and excludes contradiction. Defined by the capacity to think without forming impossible or self-negating ideas.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Logos
A term often used to describe divine reason or the Word of God. Here treated as a concept dependent on diversity and thus impossible in a state of complete equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Making the Law
The process of codifying behavioural preferences into enforceable rules. May occur through enforcement (power) or persuasion (shared value formation), often requiring public debate and consensus in democratic contexts.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Meaning
The experiential content associated with a label. Meaning is what we recall when encountering a word whose definition we have memorised.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Mind-Feeling-Body Consciousness
The integrated awareness of one’s own thoughts and feeling body. This marks the emergence of self-consciousness and the capacity for identity-based choice.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Miscommunication
A failure in correct communication, arising from mismatched definitions—either due to differing experiences or incorrect associations between labels and meanings.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Mixed Choice
A decision involving one attractive and one repulsive option. The subject must weigh opposing emotional pulls to determine which is stronger.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Model of Behaviour
A framework describing both intentional and unintentional action as outcomes of emotional direction. Behaviour arises from attraction or repulsion, with conscious choices shaped by a hierarchy of values and unconscious reactions driven by immediate emotional response. In Zero Complexity, this model replaces divine will with a natural, structured account of purpose grounded in feeling and logic.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Model of Eternity
The structural framework combining diversity and equality into a logical model of eternal existence. It underpins the book’s metaphysical foundation and the eternal switch.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Moral Preference
An emotionally grounded preference regarding behaviour, typically concerning notions of right and wrong. Forms the basis for legal and ethical judgement.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Moral Subjectivism
The view that moral judgements arise from emotional evaluations and personal value hierarchies. Contrasts with claims of objective or divinely revealed morality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Morality
A form of empathic judgement applied specifically to deliberate behaviour, provided the thought process behind the behaviour is sufficiently complex. Distinct from aesthetic or orthotic evaluation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Mutually Exclusive
A relation between two states—diversity and equality—where the presence of one excludes the other.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Mutually Exhaustive
A relation where two categories—diversity and equality—account for all possible realities, leaving no room for a ‘third’ state.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Near Equalisation
A partial or intermediate stage of equalisation, in which distinct elements merge into a singular, but still identifiable, state.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Negative Theology
A theological stance that defines God only through negation—e.g., “unknowable,” “beyond understanding,” or “beyond language.” Shown to collapse into a form of diversity and thus still subject to the model of eternal duality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
No Definition, No Truth
A principle stating that without established definitions, words cannot be judged as true or false. Truth presupposes shared and meaningful definitions.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Non-Conscious Body
All physiological processes not governed by thought—including the immune system, hormonal changes, reflexes, and other bodily systems.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Non-Creator Divinity
A hypothetical supernatural being who exists within reality rather than beyond it, and who did not create the universe. Not dismissed as impossible, but clearly distinguished from the traditional creator God.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Nothingness
A state of equality without energy, lacking any identity, change, or possibility of creation. Defined not just by absence, but by the impossibility of transformation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Numbness
A state of emotional absence—serving as the primary background against which emotions can be distinguished. Represents the endpoint of emotional equalisation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Objective Existence
The assumed independent reality of things outside the mind, though it can only be inferred through subjective perception.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Objective Experience
An impossible concept. All experiences are made conscious within the mind and are therefore subjective. While we may infer the objective existence of things outside the mind—such as roads or rocks—our experience of them always occurs within consciousness. Thus, even shared or repeated experiences remain subjective in form.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Omniscience
The state of possessing complete and unlimited knowledge. In this text, omniscience is shown to be unverifiable from a human standpoint, as no individual can confirm whether another being knows everything. Thus, any claim of divine omniscience—such as by a prophet or scripture—remains unprovable and cannot serve as evidence of infallibility.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Ontological Equality
The metaphysical notion of sameness or indistinction, often associated in the book with the dimensionless state of zero complexity. Distinct from social or legal equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Ontological One
A state of singular existence without internal distinction—no parts, no contrasts, no structure. Though something exists, it cannot be known, because sameness makes detection impossible. Ontological One is real but unknowable: being without recognisability.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Ontological Two
A state of minimal diversity—the first condition in which difference exists. Two distinct entities or properties enable contrast, identity, and transformation. Ontological Two marks the foundation of recognition, meaning, and intelligence: the starting point of all knowability.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Ontological Zero
A state of absolute non-existence—no entities, no energy, no space, no time. This is not emptiness but total absence, with no potential for transformation or emergence. Nothing exists, and nothing can arise. It represents the true zero of being.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Open Speech / Openness
The willingness to listen to and consider alternative perspectives, regardless of their source. A critical complement to free speech, enabling persuasion and value-sharing.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Opportunity-Based System
A model of governance in which individuals influence law through persuasion, rather than through inherited authority. Defined by equal access to legislative participation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Original Sin
The theological doctrine that humanity inherited guilt or punishment due to the first moral failure. Zero Complexity challenges this idea as unjustifiable, given the absence of fully autonomous will.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Orthotic Goodness
Correctness as defined by adherence to a standard, rule, or expectation—e.g., spelling a word properly or following legal norms. Orthotic judgements do not depend on emotional reaction but may elicit one.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Others’ Consciousness
The recognition that another mind is experiencing or perceiving something. This higher-order awareness requires not only detecting contrast in the world, but detecting that someone else is detecting it.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Passive Tolerance
A social posture in which individuals refrain from acting on disagreement, but retain internal opposition. May maintain superficial harmony while concealing unresolved conflicts.
Peace
The absence of conflict; specifically, a state in which all individuals either share behavioural preferences or do not object to one another’s behaviours.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Peace Clock
A metaphorical model illustrating the progression from conflict to peace through incremental acts of deep persuasion. Represents the expansion of shared understanding over time.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Perfection
Defined as complete alignment with a given standard. Perfection is observable and evidence-based, unlike infallibility, which requires an impossibility of error.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).

Personhood
The condition of being recognised as a person, grounded in the capacity for emotion and consciousness. It is this recognition—not biology or identity—that qualifies individuals for equal legal and moral consideration.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Persuasion
The act of changing another person’s behaviour by altering their underlying preference or intention. It occurs in two forms: shallow persuasion, where a stronger emotional response temporarily overrides a desire (e.g. fear of punishment), and deep persuasion, where the desire itself is removed through a change in belief or emotional orientation. Only deep persuasion fully resolves conflict by creating shared preferences.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Primary Background
The baseline state against which sensations, emotions, or thoughts are contrasted. For sight, this is the blind field; for sound, silence; for emotion, numbness.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Primary Certainty
A default state of belief or confidence held without questioning or comparison to alternatives. It reflects the absence of doubt prior to analysis and is often sustained by habit, authority, or dogma. Unlike reasoned conviction, primary certainty can persist even without evidence, making it a common foundation for unquestioned beliefs.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Primary Subject
The initial or main object of evaluation—e.g., a shirt, person, or action—which initiates emotional appraisal.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Primary Value
The emotional response elicited by the primary subject alone, without reference to secondary associations.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Principle of Consciousness
The notion that consciousness requires diversity. Without distinct thoughts or perceptions, self-awareness dissolves into unconsciousness.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Principle of Detection
States that perception—whether sensory or instrumental—requires difference. Without contrast, nothing can be seen, heard, felt, or measured.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Principle of Identity
Identity can only arise where diversity exists. Equalisation removes all identity, including the self.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Principle of Life
Asserts that death represents the complete and irreversible equalisation of consciousness—when all identity, perception, and awareness are lost.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Prophetic Revelation
The claim that a human received divine knowledge directly from God. Shown to be unverifiable, since no human can confirm the omniscience of the revealer.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Purpose
The desired prospect or predicted outcome that causes an action or event. Purpose arises only in the presence of intentional behaviour and conscious evaluation.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Purpose Without God
The central claim that life can be meaningful without belief in or the existence of God, provided emotional value is present in one’s experiences, relationships, or goals.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Reality
All that exists, whether subjective or objective. In Zero Complexity, reality includes thoughts, feelings, and external events alike.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Recall (definition)
The mental process of retrieving either a label from a remembered experience, or an experience from a known label. Enables practical use of definitions.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Recognition
The mental process of identifying a previously encountered difference through memory. It requires both contrast and recall, and is essential for conscious awareness and understanding.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Reflex
An automatic, physiological reaction bypassing thought and emotion—for example, a knee-jerk response. Not a form of intentional behaviour.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Reformable Law
A law that can be revised, challenged, or repealed through reasoned argument, public discourse, or democratic consensus. Its legitimacy depends on persuasion, not divine authority, and it evolves with changing understanding and collective agreement. Contrasted with immutable law, which is considered fixed and unquestionable.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Relativism
A philosophical stance that denies the legitimacy of any moral claims beyond individual preference. While promoting equality, it suppresses persuasion and hinders legal progress by rejecting the notion that moral ideas can be better or worse.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Relativistic Absolutism
A contradiction in which all individuals are seen as equally unqualified to judge, yet a single source (e.g. scripture) is elevated as absolutely authoritative. Results in a society where no person can persuade, but one fixed system dominates all.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Religious Belief
A belief based on presumed divine authority or sacred texts, often held as infallible and resistant to revision. Distinguished from scientific belief, which evolves with evidence, religious belief typically maintains certainty through faith rather than empirical verification.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Religious Discrimination
A form of exclusion or judgment based on a person’s belief or non-belief in a particular religion. Often stems not from individual malice but from theological doctrines—especially those that link salvation or damnation to religious allegiance.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Religious Existential Dissatisfaction
A psychological or existential state caused by the belief that life without God is inherently incomplete. Attributed to misunderstandings of infinity, fulfilment, and the nature of emotional purpose.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Repulsion (Emotional)
A negative emotional force that pushes a subject away from a thought, object, or action. A central component of intentional behavioural direction.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Right and Wrong
Judgements of behaviour as good or bad, made aesthetically (beauty), empathically (morality), or orthotically (correctness). The phrase doing the right thing may reflect any of these evaluative categories.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Scientific belief
A belief based on evidence, open to revision in light of new data. Distinguished from religious belief, which resists change due to presumed infallibility.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Scriptural Infallibility
The belief that religious texts are perfect and divinely authored. Rejected in this book on the grounds that no omniscient authorship can be proven and that some claims (e.g. divine creation) are logically flawed.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Second Pillar: There Is No Third Reality
A metaphysical claim that all realities must fall into one of two mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories: diversity or equality. Any supposed ‘third’ would either collapse into one of these or contradict itself.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Secondary Background
The surrounding set of variations against which a specific perception or emotion is recognised—such as one colour among many, or one emotion among several.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Secondary Certainty
A reasoned conviction that something cannot be otherwise, reached only after explicit doubt has been examined and resolved. Unlike primary certainty or religious dogma, it results from rigorous analysis and the elimination of contradiction, making it resilient to scrutiny and stable under challenge.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Secondary Subject
An object, memory, or concept associated with the primary subject, contributing to added emotional meaning—either as derived or consequential value.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Secondary Value
Any emotional value added to the primary subject through its association with secondary subjects. This includes both derived value (value from which the primary subject originates) and consequential value (value resulting from outcomes related to the primary subject).
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Self-Awareness
The reflective awareness of one’s own thoughts and emotions. It enables subjective experience of freedom, even when choices are determined by subconscious or external forces.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Self-Consciousness
The recognition of oneself as a unified subject composed of a feeling body and a thinking mind. Enables the concept of possession, agency, and identity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Self-Creation
The claim that something brings itself into existence. Rejected as a logical and linguistic contradiction—akin to a “triangular circle.” Since self-creation implies the ability to change, it presupposes the existence of energy. But in a state of nothingness, where energy is absent, no change is possible. 
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Sense Equalisation
The experiential loss of detectable difference across a sensory field. It occurs when variation within or between sensory inputs disappears, causing the associated experience—such as sight, sound, or touch—to merge into undifferentiated sameness. This process leads to the disappearance of identity, detectability, and ultimately, conscious perception.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Sense of Purpose
The emotional drive or orientation toward a subject of purpose. It represents the internal experience of meaningfulness and direction in life.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Shallow Persuasion
Behavioural change driven by a stronger emotional incentive or deterrent, rather than a shift in underlying preference. Examples include acting out of fear of punishment or desire for reward.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Simplest Evaluation
An evaluative process involving only a single factor or subject, typically with a direct emotional association and no competing alternatives. It reflects the most immediate and unambiguous form of judgment or preference.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Simulation Hypothesis
The radical possibility that all experiences are confined to the mind, implying that even seemingly objective realities may be artificial or constructed.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Social Equality (Group Equality)
The identification of a shared characteristic that defines individuals as members of the same legal or moral group. In Zero Complexity, emotional capacity and consciousness are the universal basis for such grouping.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Social Equality by Inferiority
A condition in which individuals are considered equally unqualified to challenge or revise a fixed moral source. Common in absolutist systems, where no human judgement is seen as sufficient to override a presumed infallible authority.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Social Equality Laws
Two foundational principles: (1) All are equal under the law, and (2) All are equal above the law. Together, they define a peaceful and democratic society, resilient to tyranny, absolutism, and relativism.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Space
A measure of separation between points—arising from the difference between ‘here’ and ‘there’. Space depends on distinguishable locations and boundaries, and thus only exists in a reality of diversity. In a state of equality, where no parts or limits exist, space is absent. Like time, space emerges from difference and vanishes in perfect sameness.
Speech (Political Definition)
In the context of peacebuilding, speech refers not simply to expression, but to the active process of persuasion in moral or legislative discourse. True speech is both free (from coercion) and open (to counterargument).
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Spirituality
A belief in a possible supernatural or mysterious dimension to existence, which may or may not include a personal deity. Distinguished from religion by its lack of structured doctrine or institutional allegiance.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Standard (of perfection)
A benchmark or expectation used to assess whether something is perfect. Without a standard, the concept of perfection is meaningless.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Subconscious Detection
The recognition of difference without deliberate awareness. Subconscious detection allows the mind to respond to contrast automatically—such as noticing danger, recognising faces, or interpreting tone—without forming explicit thoughts. It operates beneath conscious reasoning but still depends on ontological diversity; without difference, nothing can be sensed, processed, or felt.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Subconscious Hierarchy of Value
An ordered structure of emotional intensities existing beneath conscious awareness. These subconscious values influence thought, behaviour, and decision-making.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Subconscious Jump
The spontaneous emergence of thoughts, emotions, or memories from the subconscious into conscious awareness. Cannot be directly chosen or commanded.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).

Subject of Purpose
The object, goal, or outcome to which the sense of purpose is directed—e.g., a career, loved one, or cause.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Subjective Reality
Anything that exists because of the mind—thoughts, emotions, imagination—even if those things are mistaken for objective events.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Supernatural (divine) Diversity
A spiritual or religious realm characterised by difference—e.g., multiple souls or spirits. As with natural diversity, it implies space, time, and identity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Supernatural (divine) Energy
The hypothetical supernatural capacity to act or cause change, attributed to God or spiritual beings. Considered equivalent to energy in the natural realm in its transformative role.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Supernatural (divine) Equality
A formless, timeless state within religious cosmology, equated in the text with the general metaphysical concept of equality. Lacks identity and therefore cannot contain intelligence.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
The Jungle–Zoo–Home Model
A three-stage framework describing societal progression towards peace:
– Jungle: A state of open conflict and violence.
– Zoo: A state of externally enforced peace via segregation and avoidance, lacking true integration.
– Home: A state of private and public tolerance where individuals relate with mutual respect, akin to familial affection.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Theocracy
A system of governance or ideology in which divine authority—typically via scripture—determines legal or moral norms. Critiqued for undermining open discourse and democratic processes.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Theocratic Religiosity
A religious worldview that places God above humanity in value, typically endorsing divine command as morally or legally absolute. Opposed in this work in favour of human-centred religiosity.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Theology of Diversity
A reinterpretation of negative theology. Argued here that even the most abstract or negated concepts of God (e.g., “beyond,” “not,” “infinite”) imply difference, placing God within the model of eternity, not beyond it.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Theory of Everything
A unifying explanatory framework for behaviour, existence, and meaning. In Zero Complexity, it integrates models of causality, eternity, and emotional agency, placing self-consciousness as the source of all value in the cosmos.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Third Pillar: A First Reality Is One of Equality
If there was a beginning to existence, it could not have involved diversity, since diversity requires relation and structure. Therefore, the first state must have been a formless, undifferentiated equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Thought
A mental event that, to be recognised, must differ from other mental events or from silence. Thought is impossible in pure equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Thought-Feeling Process
The interwoven cognitive and emotional structure that underpins evaluation, value judgement, and decision-making.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Time
A measure of change between moments—arising from the difference between ‘before’ and ‘after’. Time exists only in a reality of diversity, where distinctions between events make change possible. In a state of perfect equality, time is absent, as no change or difference can occur. The infinite presence of time defines a dynamic eternity; its infinite absence defines a static one.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Triangular Circle
A metaphor used to highlight logical contradictions—particularly applied to concepts like self-creation or a third type of reality beyond diversity and equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Truth (speaking the truth)
The act of using words that accurately represent reality and correspond to shared definitions. Requires both correct labelling and mutual understanding.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Tyranny
A system of rule in which one individual or group imposes their will through force, placing themselves above and outside the law. Tyranny prevents both speech and reform, and leads to societal instability.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Unconditional Love
Affection and commitment not contingent on specific behaviours or beliefs. The book argues that divine love, when tied to judgement or punishment, cannot truly be unconditional.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Unconsciousness
The full equalisation of all sensory and cognitive fields. It marks the absence of conscious awareness, where no thoughts, sensations, or emotions are distinguishable. Often regarded as a composite state of blindness, deafness, and emotional numbness.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Unintelligent Equality
A core conclusion of the text: a state of equality cannot support thought, identity, or intention, whether labelled divine or natural.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Unintentional Behaviour
Actions or changes that occur without a subject’s choice, typically due to physical forces or causal chains. Examples include natural events like wind or falling rocks.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Universal Equalisation
The total merging of all forms of diversity—across space, time, matter, mind, and emotion—into a singular, undifferentiated state of equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Universe (or multiverse)
Used interchangeably to describe the totality of natural existence, presumed to be either infinitely diverse or bounded by a state of equality.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Unlabelled Experience
An experience that has not yet been associated with a label. It is real but linguistically unexpressed.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Value
The emotional weight assigned to a subject, option, or experience. Positive emotions define positive value; negative emotions define negative value. Value intensity determines choice and meaning.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Value Hierarchy (Empathic)
A structure in which beings are valued differently based on the strength of emotional response they elicit. Explains moral decision-making across species, including hypothetical interactions with aliens or non-human intelligences.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Verbum
A term meaning “word” in Latin, referring both to the Word—the metaphysical emergence of meaning—and to any individual word as its expression. Verbum marks the point at which ontological diversity becomes recognisable through contrast. 
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Visual Silence
A proposed term denoting the absence of light, in parallel to silence as the absence of sound. Unlike darkness or blackness, visual silence describes true invisibility.
Defined or developed by Robin Mains in Zero Complexity (2025).
Zero (Zero Complexity)
A state of absence—whether of existence, energy, identity, or knowledge. It may refer to true nothingness (non-existence), or to a perfectly uniform state in which nothing can be recognised. Crucially, zero can describe either the absence of energy, or the presence of undetectable energy in a state of complete sameness. The former is truly inert; the latter only appears as nothing due to lack of contrast.
