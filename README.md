Zero Complexity (2025) by Robin Mains

Zero Complexity is a philosophical manifesto that introduces the Argument from Diversity — a logical framework arguing that a creator God is logically impossible because structure requires contrast, and contrast cannot arise from pure equality.

This work presents a metaphysical model called the eternal switch — a duality between infinite equality and infinite diversity — to explain how reality can exist without creation.
